- **Xavier Worthy (KC, WR)**: Active despite shoulder/ankle concerns, remains a key target for Mahomes.

- **Matthew Stafford (LAR, QB)**: Seeing increased adds, suggesting a potential resurgence as a reliable QB option.

## Waiver Wire Pickups

1. **Hassan Haskins (LAC, RB) 🏃‍♂️**
   - **Reasoning**: With Hampton sidelined, Haskins is likely to see an increased workload. His high add rate suggests confidence in his immediate impact.

2. **Kimani Vidal (LAC, RB) 🏃‍♂️**
   - **Reasoning**: Another RB benefiting from Hampton's absence. A solid stash with potential for immediate contributions.

3. **Ryan Flournoy (DAL, WR) 📈**
   - **Reasoning**: Trending upwards with significant adds. He could emerge as a reliable WR option, especially in deeper leagues.

4. **AJ Barner (SEA, TE) 🏈**
   - **Reasoning**: Coming off a two-touchdown game, Barner is a great pickup if you're in need of tight end depth.

5. **Matthew Stafford (LAR, QB) 🏆**
   - **Reasoning**: A veteran QB seeing a resurgence. Worth a pickup if you're streaming QBs or need depth at the position.

## Players to Consider Dropping

- **Arizona Cardinals (DEF) 🏴**
  - **Reasoning**: High drop trend indicates decreased confidence in their defensive performances.
  
- **Zach Ertz (WAS, TE) 🏴**
  - **Reasoning**: Declining usage and production make him a less appealing option at TE.
  
- **Justice Hill (BAL, RB) 🏴**
  - **Reasoning**: Limited impact in recent games and trending down in roster percentage.

- **Darius Slayton (NYG, WR) 🏴**
  - **Reasoning**: Questionable status with injuries and minimal fantasy output make him expendable.
