Fantasy Football Stock Report: Week 6
Fantasy Football Risers
Rico Dowdle (RB – CAR)
Rico Dowdle was dominant in his first start with Carolina, playing 67.1% (47 out of 70) of the offensive snaps, while handling 26 touches for 234 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown. His 206 yards on the ground were the most by any player this season, averaging nine yards per carry and scoring 32.4 PPR, finishing as the RB1 overall on the week.
As a receiver, Dowdle saw four targets on the day, catching three for 28 yards, trailing only
Tetairoa McMillan
(26.7%) for second on the team in target share (13.3%).
Chuba Hubbard
is questionable for Week 6, but it would not at all be shocking to see Dowdle command a larger share of the backfield going forward, especially in a revenge game against the Cowboys.
Rachaad White (RB – TB)
Rachaad White reclaimed his starting role in
Bucky Irving
‘s absence in Week 5, playing on 80.3% (49 out of 61) of the offensive snaps, while handling 18 touches for 71 yards from scrimmage and a pair of touchdowns. He was inefficient on the ground, averaging fewer than three yards per carry (2.9). He was productive as a receiver, though, running a route on nearly 80% of
Baker Mayfield
‘s dropbacks (79.4%) and finishing tied for second on the team in receptions, catching all four of his targets for 30 yards.
Per Adam Schefter, Bucky Irving’s shoulder injury is more of an issue than his sprained foot, likely sidelining the second year back for at least two weeks. Until Irving returns, White should have complete control of the backfield, possessing RB1 upside as the starter.
Michael Carter (RB – ARI)
With no
James Conner
and
Trey Benson
in Week 5, both landing on the injured reserve (IR) list, there was a lot of speculation on the distribution of the backfield touches, but
Michael Carter
separated himself as the clear lead back, out-snapping
Emari Demercado
39 to 19, while handling 23 touches for 73 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown.
Although Demercado led the team in rushing yards (81) thanks to a 71-yard breakaway run, he only saw three carries on the day and could see his usage scale back after a costly fumble at the goal line, resulting in a touchback. Carter should be the preferred back for at least three more games, if not longer, depending on Bensen’s status.
Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB – WSH)
Jacory Croskey-Merritt
‘s usage had been disappointing in his first two games without
Austin Ekeler
, failing to see double-digit opportunities in both outings, losing significant work to
Chris Rodriguez Jr.
and
Jeremy McNichols
and averaging only nine touches for 44 yards from scrimmage. That all changed in Week 5, with the Commanders finally naming Croskey-Merritt the starter, who made the most of his opportunities, playing on 47.5% of the offensive snaps, while handling a career-high 16 touches for 150 yards from scrimmage and a pair of scores.
Even as a seventh-round rookie, Croskey-Merritt has been one of the most efficient backs in the league, leading the NFL in rushing yards over expected per attempt (2.17), yards per carry (6.6) and Pro Football Focus (PFF) run grade (90.1). His snap share and usage should only increase going forward, continuing to widen the gap in the backfield.
Fantasy Football Fallers
Woody Marks (RB – HOU)
Woody Marks had seen his snap share and usage increase every week up until Sunday, getting outplayed by
Nick Chubb
and handling seven touches for 24 scoreless yards.
Although Marks led the backfield in snaps (27 out of 70, 38.6%), he was far less efficient with his touches, averaging 3.4 yards per carry (YPC) compared to 5.5 YPC for Chubb. This, despite facing an abysmal Ravens defense ranked 26th in
DVOA
(defense-adjusted value over average) against the rush (11.6%), allowing the fifth-most rushing yards (116) and a league-high 34.4 PPR points per game to opposing backs.
Derrick Henry (RB – BAL)
Derrick Henry salvaged his day with a touchdown, but was held to only 33 combined rushing and receiving yards in a 44-10 blowout loss against the Texans. Although Henry played on over 65% of the Ravens’ offensive snaps (28 out of 43) for the first time this season, he was inefficient with his touches, averaging 2.2 yards per carry. He was already losing work to
Justice Hill
and now
Keaton Mitchell
, who was active for the first time in Week 5.
Since Henry’s RB1 overall finish in Week 1, he’s ranked outside the top 24 among backs in each of his last three games, averaging 12.3 touches on 12.8 opportunities for 42.8 yards from scrimmage and eight PPR points during that span. He’s been a game-dependent player, which isn’t great with
Lamar Jackson
likely sidelined another week and possibly longer.
Alvin Kamara (RB – NO)
The Saints got their first win under Kellen Moore, which ultimately hurt Alvin Kamara, playing on only 56.1% of the team’s offense snaps, his lowest mark of the season. Kamara was also outcarried 10 to 8 by
Kendre Miller
, who continues to work his way into a larger role, seeing his snap share and usage increase every week.
Taysom Hill
was also active in this game, immediately taking away carries from the backfield, rushing six times for -1 yard. At 30 years old on a non-competitive team, Kamara likely continues to see his workload and usage scale back, which could be detrimental to his fantasy value going forward.
Omarion Hampton (RB – LAC)
Omarion Hampton was featured early and often in Week 5, handling 18 total touches for 70 yards from scrimmage before exiting in the fourth quarter with an ankle injury.
Unfortunately, the ankle injury proved to be more serious than initially thought, resulting in Hampton being placed on IR and forced to miss at least the next four games. Reports suggest Hampton should be back once he’s eligible to return, but missing a full month hurts his rest of season outlook.
