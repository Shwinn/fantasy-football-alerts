==================================================

Week 7 delivers a heavyweight Big Ten showdown as Curt Cignetti’s Indiana Hoosiers travel west to face the third-ranked Oregon Ducks in Autzen Stadium. Both teams boast top-10 rankings on offense and defense, and both have quarterbacks firmly in the Heisman Trophy conversation.
With red-zone execution bordering on perfection on both sides, this matchup promises fireworks from start to finish — a true litmus test for Indiana’s rise and Oregon’s playoff ambitions. If you haven’t taken notice of Notre Dame quarterback CJ Carr, now is the time to do so.

#7 Indiana @ #3 Oregon (-7.5) | 55.5 | Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS
Curt Cignetti has Indiana on the right track, but are they on the same track as Oregon? We find out this Saturday in Autzen Stadium. Both teams are ranked in the top 10 for scoring on both offense and defense. Indiana is scoring on 89% of its red-zone trips, and Oregon has allowed each red-zone possession on defense to end in points.
Oregon’s offense has scored on every red-zone trip this season, and much like Oregon’s defense, Indiana has failed to stop a team from scoring in the red zone. We will be treated to two high-flying offenses led by two excellent quarterbacks who are both in the hunt for the Heisman Trophy in
Fernando Mendoza
of Indiana and
Dante Moore
of Oregon.
Oregon’s receiving attack is led by true freshman
Dakorien Moore
, who is still looking to crack his first 100-yard game. Indiana is led by veterans Omar Cooper Jr. and
Elijah Sarratt
. Both teams deploy a two-man rotation at running back, almost always having a fresh body in the backfield.
On paper, we couldn’t have a matchup that is more even than this one on both sides of the ball. Hopefully, we will see a high-tempo, high-scoring game that goes back and forth for 60 minutes. Cignetti and Indiana have been making some noise the past year, but going west to Eugene will play a factor in this one.
My Picks:
Moneyline: Oregon (
-295
)
Spread: Indiana +7.5 (
-112
)
Total: Over 55.5 (
-105

Devy Spotlight
CJ Carr (QB – Notre Dame) | 2027
CJ Carr was a four-star recruit and a top-10 quarterback, per 247Sports, in his class. He sat out his first season at Notre Dame and won the starting job this offseason. With his impressive play so far against top defenses in Miami and Texas A&M, there have been rumblings that he is the early QB1 for the 2027 class. Through his first five career starts, he has thrown for nearly 1,300 yards on a close to 68% completion rate with 11 touchdowns to two interceptions.
This week, Carr and Notre Dame face NC State at home, which has one of the weakest pass defenses in the nation, allowing 243 passing yards per game. Carr threw for 354 yards and four touchdowns against Arkansas, which allows 257 passing yards per game.
Heisman Trophy Race
The top five Heisman favorites after Week 6:
Carson Beck (QB – Miami)
|
+600
Dante Moore (QB – Oregon)
|
+600
Ty Simpson (QB – Alabama)
|
+750
Jeremiah Smith (WR – Ohio State)
|
+850
Julian Sayin (QB – Ohio State)
|
+1400
Carson Beck leapfrogs Dante Moore (bye week) and Ty Simpson (win over Vanderbilt) for the top spot after throwing for 241 yards and four touchdowns on the road against rival Florida State.
Stud wide receiver Jeremiah Smith snagged another two touchdowns against Minnesota, but had his second-lowest yardage output so far (67 yards). Smith’s quarterback, Julian Sayin, has been close to lights out to start his career. Completing over 80% of passes to go along with 13 touchdowns to only three interceptions.
Notre Dame signal-caller CJ Carr sits just outside the top five at
+2000
. If he continues to play efficiently and Notre Dame wins out, his odds will continue to rise each week.
