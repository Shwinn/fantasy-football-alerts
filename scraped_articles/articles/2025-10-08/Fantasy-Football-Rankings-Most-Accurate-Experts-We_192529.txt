What is Fantasy Football?
Fantasy football is a game that allows you to act as a virtual general manager for a football team. In fantasy football, you select and manage a team of real NFL players. The players on your team earn points for your team based on their real-life performance in games each week. These points are then totaled and compared to your opponent’s team each week to determine the winner.
At the beginning of the season, you participate in a draft with other fantasy football players. During the draft, you take turns selecting players from the NFL to add to your team. The goal is to build the best team possible with the players you select.
During the season, you can make
trades
with other players, pick up new players from the free agent pool, and even drop players from your team who aren’t performing well. You can also make strategic decisions each week about which players to start in your lineup.
Overall, fantasy football is a fun and exciting way to get more involved in the NFL season. It allows you to put your knowledge of the game to the test and compete with others to see who can build the best team. And with the right
strategy
and a bit of luck, you could be the one taking home the championship trophy at the end of the season!
