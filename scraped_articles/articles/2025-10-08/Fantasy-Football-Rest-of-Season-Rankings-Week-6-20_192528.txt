Successful In-Season Fantasy Football Management
Once your fantasy football team is drafted, the work is not over. Successful in-season management is crucial to a winning fantasy football season. Here are some tips to help you manage your team effectively throughout the season:
Stay up to date on player news
Keep track of player injuries, suspensions, and other news that may impact their performance. This will help you make informed decisions about which players to start each week.
Monitor the waiver wire
Keep an eye on the
waiver wire
and be ready to pick up players who may be undervalued or overlooked by other teams. This can provide valuable depth to your roster. Use our
waiver wire assistant
to view optimal lineups, waiver and trade suggestions, and league analysis.
Analyze matchups
Analyze the upcoming matchups for your players and opponents to determine which players to start in your lineup each week. Look for favorable matchups and take into account the strength of the opposing team’s defense.
Stay active in trades
Be open to trading players with other teams if it will benefit your team.
Analyze the potential impact of a trade
before making a decision and negotiate with other teams to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
Be prepared for bye weeks
Plan ahead for bye weeks by having backup players ready to fill in for your starters. Avoid having too many players with the same bye week, which can leave your team short-handed.
Don’t overreact to one bad week
Avoid overreacting to one bad week of performance by a player. Take a long-term view of their performance and evaluate their potential moving forward.
Continuously evaluate your roster
Continuously evaluate your roster throughout the season and make adjustments as needed. Be willing to drop underperforming players or make changes to your lineup if necessary.
