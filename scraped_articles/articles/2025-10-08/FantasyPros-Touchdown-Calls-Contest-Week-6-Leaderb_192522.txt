How It Works
Each week, we’ll post a link to a contest form on the
FantasyPros Discord
server in the
#touchdown-calls
channel. From there, you just need to click on the link to open the form, enter your FantasyPros username and email address, and then follow the instructions within the form to make your touchdown calls for the week.
Rules
Making your call is easy.
You will choose
FOUR
players who you think will score a touchdown this week.
The
Bonus Flex
touchdown call will be worth 2x the number of touchdowns he scores for this week.
Your
RB
,
WR
, and
TE
calls will each receive 1x the number of touchdowns he scores this week.
The Twist
Once you have called a player, you
CANNOT
call that player again. If you duplicate, you will receive no points for any of that player’s TDs after the first call.
Prizes
The best part about the contest? We’re giving out weekly AND season-long prizes. We will keep track of the overall leaderboard and will post the results in Discord every week, so you’ll know exactly where you stand before making next week’s picks. Not only will we announce the weekly winners’ and overall season leaders’ names each and every week on the
FantasyPros Football Podcast
, but there will be weekly and season-long prizes:
Weekly winner
: $25 gift card to the
FantasyPros store.
Season-long winner
:
Bijan Robinson Signed
Jersey
And that’s to say nothing of bragging rights into perpetuity. So get those picks in now, and start your journey toward FantasyPros immortality.
