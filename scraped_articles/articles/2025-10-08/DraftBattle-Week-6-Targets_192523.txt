DraftBattle: Week 6 Targets
Ryan Flournoy (WR – DAL)
Flournoy broke out in Week 5, leading the Dallas Cowboys with nine targets (32 percent target share) and responding with six receptions for a team-high 114 receiving yards and 10 rushing yards on two attempts. The Cowboys have been waiting for someone to step up and take the number three role on the offense, a role that currently makes them the number two for as long as
CeeDee Lamb
is sidelined. The fact that Flournoy not only broke out but did so in a game where he had enough of
Dak Prescott’s
trust to tie
Jake Ferguson
with a team-high nine targets suggests that he will see an expanded role going forward. Flournoy appears to be well worth targeting in the late rounds of your Week 6 DraftBattle drafts.
Stefon Diggs (WR – NE)
Diggs is looking rejuvenated in New England with
Drake Maye
. He has recorded back-to-back 100 yard receiving games for the first time in 22 games and showed the world that he can be just as dominant as he was in Minnesota and Buffalo. Diggs may not see the kind of volume he did against Buffalo most weeks, but if the Patriots want to balance out their offense and really let Drake Maye shine, we could see Diggs force his way back into the WR1 conversation. For now, we can still consider him a top-20 option. There is an argument for inclusion in the top-15 after his recent performances and the name equity on a bye this week, but facing a team like New Orleans may severely cap Drake Maye’s need to throw the ball to his number one target with any significant volume. Tap Diggs as one of the better WR options for a Week 6 matchup against a New Orleans Saints team that has relinquished at least 69 receiving yards and a score to all four of the number one wideouts they have faced this season (
Malik Nabers
did not play against New Orleans). Target Diggs as a WR2 with WR1 upside for Week 6 at DraftBattle.
Jaylen Waddle (WR – MIA)
This name is a little too obvious for this list if the discussion just centered around him being the number one receiver with
Tyreek Hill
lost for the season. However, what we need to ascertain before joining Week 6 DraftBattle leagues is exactly how high we should be drafting someone like Waddle. Waddle has weekly top-12 upside in his new role and has the talent to match. The Miami Dolphins, being the Miami Dolphins, may cap his upside a bit, but he can still cook with a high-volume, low air yard role, as we have seen in the past. Due to the volatility of the Dolphins’ offense and team as a whole, it is better to view Waddle as a low-end WR1 option. There is an argument for him to be a top-eight or even top-five receiver taken, especially with two WR1s on bye this week in
Justin Jefferson
and
Nico Collins
. Waddle is a name to seriously consider in the second to fourth rounds in your DraftBattle Week 6 contests.
