==================================================

We’ve now gone through five weeks of the 2025 NFL season, so the fantasy community is naturally panicking on several marquee players.
On this page, we’re going to take a look at five players who were selected in the first seven rounds of drafts or have fizzled out after strong starts, determining at what level you should be panicking.

Fantasy Football Panic Meter: Week 5
Jameson Williams (WR – DET)
We’ve officially reached red alert on Jameson Williams. The big-play wideout has put up only 11 catches for 223 yards and a touchdown this season. Williams is currently averaging 6.8 fantasy points per game in half-PPR formats, which ranks as the WR59. The Lions’ No. 2 wide receiver has put up 5.5 points or fewer in four out of five games. The usage hasn’t been good either, as Williams has four targets or fewer in three of his last four games.
I really had high hopes that Williams would have a breakout against a porous Bengals defense in Week 4, but that didn’t even come close to happening. Perhaps the loss of Ben Johnson has had a major impact on Williams, as he hasn’t had schemed-up open looks like last year. I’m in full-blown panic mode here.
Verdict
: 9 out of 10 on the Panic Meter
Justin Herbert (QB – LAC)
Justin Herbert started the season strong, but he’s been held to fewer than 16 fantasy points in three consecutive games. I had high hopes for a bounce-back game against a Commanders defense that had just been shredded by
Michael Penix Jr.
, but that didn’t happen.
Herbert has been impacted by an injury-plagued offensive line that is now without
Joe Alt
. Up next is another great matchup on paper against the Dolphins, who have one of the worst defenses in the NFL. If Herbert can’t get going there, it may be time to leave him on your bench.
Verdict
: 4 out of 10 on the Panic Meter
Chris Olave (WR – NO)
Chris Olave has been a “PPR scam” this year, putting up terrific volume (54 targets) with low efficiency (7.4 yards per catch). Before this season, Olave had 12+ yards per reception in each of his three years in the NFL. With that said, I love the usage Kellen Moore has schemed up for Olave, getting him more layup looks.
I’m not worried about Olave at all because this is a bet on volume. While the touchdowns won’t be there too often in a low-scoring offense, hold the fort with Olave, since the efficiency should go up due to positive regression. In other words, eventually Olave will be able to convert bigger plays.
Verdict
: 2 out of 10 on the Panic Meter
Tetairoa McMillan (WR – CAR)
Tetairoa McMillan is the rare example of a player who has performed at a high level in real life, but hasn’t gotten it done in fantasy. But you have to love the volume for the rookie, recording eight or more targets in every game this season.
Eventually,
Bryce Young
is going to find McMillan in the end zone. He’s been too good for that not to happen. Considering these factors, McMillan is one of my favorite buy-lows in fantasy right now.
Verdict
: 1 out of 10 on the Panic Meter
TreVeyon Henderson (RB – NE)
TreVeyon Henderson has been underwhelming so far, as the Patriots continue to lean on
Rhamondre Stevenson
, even despite fumbling issues. With
Antonio Gibson
now out for the season, that means Henderson could see more touches. But Stevenson will continue to dominate red-zone usage, making it difficult for Henderson to make enough of an impact.
As much as I (and others in the fantasy community) have complained about Henderson’s lack of touches, we also have to acknowledge that he hasn’t exactly been impressive, averaging only 3.8 yards per carry and six yards per reception. With that in mind, I’m a bit concerned.
Verdict
: 5 out of 10 on the Panic Meter
