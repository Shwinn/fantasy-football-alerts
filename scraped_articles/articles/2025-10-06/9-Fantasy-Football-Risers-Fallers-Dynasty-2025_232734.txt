==================================================

With five weeks of trends and usage under our belts, the outlooks for many players are beginning to crystallize. With that in mind, we’re digging a bit deeper with the dynasty fantasy football risers and fallers than the last few weeks. Let’s dig in.

Dynasty Fantasy Football Risers
Javonte Williams (RB – DAL)
After suffering a multi-ligament knee injury in his second NFL season, Javonte Williams was a shell of himself the past two seasons. Despite a strong landing spot in Dallas, most assumed that Williams would produce another inefficient season before being replaced, leaving his long-term value nearly nonexistent. In his third season following the injury, however, Williams looks like the Broncos rookie that elated his dynasty managers. After generating 26.9 PPR points against the Jets on Sunday, Williams now sits as the RB3 on the season. The 25-year-old made the most of his 16 carries, posting a season-high 135 rushing yards with a score. He added a second touchdown on a four-yard reception and has now visited the endzone six times this season. Looking fully back to his pre-injury form, Williams is one of fantasy football’s early season MVP’s and there’s no reason he can’t own the backfield beyond this season.
Jaylen Waddle (WR – MIA)
Once considered one of the best young dynasty wide receivers in the league, there’s been a cloud over Jaylen Waddle the last couple of years. With
Tyreek Hill
out for the season, Waddle had an opportunity on Sunday to show that he can still be the go-to player he was once labeled as, and he delivered. The fifth year pro notched season highs across the board, catching six of his nine targets for 110 yards and a score, totaling 23 fantasy points. It’s just Waddle’s third 100-yard game since the start of the 2024 season and while he will need to prove it over multiple weeks, he may become a high-end dynasty asset once again.
Emeka Egbuka (WR – TB)
Just when you think Emeka Egbuka couldn’t possibly raise his stock any higher, he goes out and torches the Seahawks secondary with seven grabs for 165 yards and a touchdown. The rookie leads all wide receivers in scoring on the week with 31.3 PPR points and didn’t let the ball hit the ground when it came his way. Egbuka was my favorite receiver prospect in the draft class, but admittedly, I didn’t envision him making a huge impact immediately. Not only has he made an impact, he’s become the clear top target for
Baker Mayfield
with
Chris Godwin
and
Mike Evans
in and out of the lineup. He’s now the WR3 on the season and that is no fluke, Egbuka is here to stay.
Mason Taylor (TE – NYJ)
For the second week in a row, rookie tight end Mason Taylor has posted season and career highs. Last week, the second-round pick caught five of his seven targets for 65 yards and 11.5 fantasy points. He topped those marks on Sunday, grabbing nine of a whopping 12 targets for 67 yards and 17.7 fantasy points. It was after Week 3 that Head Coach Aaron Glenn
declared the need to get Taylor the ball more
. In the two games since that comment, Taylor leads all tight ends with 19 targets. The offense is in desperate need of a second pass catcher to emerge behind Garret Wilson, and Taylor appears to be claiming that spot.
Gunnar Helm (TE – TEN)
Although he may be a little ways out from being relevant on a week-to-week basis, Gunner Helm has worked himself all the way up the depth chart. Helm passed
Josh Whyle
on the depth chart at the beginning of the season, but his snaps have increased the past few weeks before playing 44 this week, two more than
Chig Okonkwo
. It’s tough to say if this trend will continue, and a likely rotation between the two will limit them both, but anytime a young player takes a leap in snaps, it’s notable. The rookie caught four of his five targets for 34 yards and was an intriguing prospect coming out of Texas, making it a situation worth monitoring.
Dynasty Fantasy Football Fallers
Adonai Mitchell (WR – IND)
Through 22 games played, it often feels as though Adonai Mitchell simply cannot get out of his own way. That had never been clearer than it was last week when Mitchell caught a would be 76-yard touchdown but dropped the ball before crossing the goal line, culminating in a touchback for the Rams. With
Alec Pierce
out the last two games, Mitchell fumbled the ball and his opportunity to take a step forward. He played as the primary X receiver in place of Pierce last week but was relegated to six snaps this week.
Ashton Dulin
took over Pierce’s role, while Mitchell also lost snaps to
Anthony Gould
. Mitchell has a lot of climbing to do in order to get out of the hole he’s dug for himself.
Chase Brown (RB – CIN)
After a huge breakout season last year, Chase Brown has been equally as disappointing this season. He finished last season as the RB10 and crept up into the second round of fantasy drafts by the end of the preseason. Through five games this season, Brown sits at RB31 overall while failing to top 47 yards rushing in a game all season. The Bengals offense has been a wreck without
Joe Burrow
, but Brown’s 2.46 yards per carry are bad no matter how the rest of the offense looks.
Alvin Kamara (RB –  NO)
If you can still sell Alvin Kamara, it may be a good time to do so.
Kendre Miller
‘s usage continues to ramp up as he out-carried Kamara this week, 10 to eight. Kamara played just 56% of the snaps on Sunday, his lowest total of the season. Perhaps most alarming is that Kamara’s snaps have dropped in all situations, including short yardage and passing situations. He’s still the preferred pass catcher to Miller, and likely the better start for now, but there’s no question his value is descending and at risk of bottoming out as the season moves along.
Jerry Jeudy (WR – CLE)
No matter how bad the Browns offense is, Jerry Jeudy will see enough volume to be in the WR2/3 mix, or so they said. Well, the Browns have indeed been bad but so has Jeudy. He took his talents to London this week, catching just two passes for 15 yards, marking the second time in three weeks he has failed to hit 20 yards. Jeudy has reached double digit fantasy points in just one game this season, coming back in Week 1, and he has yet to score a touchdown this season.
