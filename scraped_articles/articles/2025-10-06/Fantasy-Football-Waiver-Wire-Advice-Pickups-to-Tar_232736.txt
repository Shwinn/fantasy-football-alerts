==================================================

Before we dig into this week’s most attractive
fantasy football waiver wire
options, let’s have a quick word about stashes.
Loosely defined, a stash is a player with little to no immediate fantasy value but the potential to develop into a useful asset. In shallow leagues with only a handful of bench spots, you might not be able to stash away such a player. But in leagues where the supply of bench spots is more generous, rostering one or two such players is generally a good idea.
An example of such a player is Chiefs running back
Brashard Smith
.
A seventh-round rookie, Smith had 1,659 yards from scrimmage and 18 touchdowns in his final college season at SMU and offers sub-4.4 speed and dual run-catch ability. Chiefs backs
Isiah Pacheco
and
Kareem Hunt
have been unproductive this season, giving Smith a chance for a greater role.
But if you’re going to roster a stash-type player, you owe it to yourself to be patient with him.
The whole point of acquiring such players is that you can add them cheaply and have a chance at a handsome profit later on. Fantasy managers are defeating the purpose of a stash if they swap out one stash for another on a near-weekly basis.
If circumstances have changed, then it’s a different story. If your stash player is injured, or lost a fumble and stopped getting offensive snaps, maybe it’s time to cut bait. But don’t get rid of a stash player simply because they haven’t panned out yet and you’re growing impatient.
The grab-and-stash strategy isn’t for everyone. Some fantasy managers are restless and like to constantly churn the bottom of their roster. They won’t wait for a stash player to gain value because they’re always looking for shiny new objects.
And honestly, this isn’t a poke at such managers. Some people simply have an aggressive managerial style. That style can absolutely be successful. But if that’s how you like to manage,
Brashard Smith
might not be for you.
If you’re more of a laissez-faire manager who’s willing to play the long game and give cheap investments time to accrue value, then stash away, my friend.
Now, let’s get to this week’s top
waiver wire
options — and top stashes.

True Value

Desperate Need

Budget-Minded
: $14
Analysis:
Going into Week 5, it was unclear how the Cardinals were going to divide the running back workload in the absence of
Trey Benson
, who was placed on injured reserve (IR) last week after sustaining a knee injury in Week 4. (Benson himself was starting in place of
James Conner
, who was lost to a season-ending foot injury.)
Michael Carter
, who began the season on Arizona’s practice squad, played 57.4% of the Cardinals’ offensive snaps in Week 5 and had a team-high 18 carries for 51 yards and a touchdown against the Titans. Carter also led the backfield in pass routes (18) and had five catches for 22 yards. As if the usage gap between Carter and
Emari Demercado
wasn’t big enough, Demercado did himself no favors by lollygagging at the end of what should have been a 72-yard touchdown run and then dropping the ball before he crossed the goal-line, blowing a chance to salt away a game that the Cardinals wound up losing 22-21. Carter figures to lead the Arizona backfield again in Week 6 and should be startable until Benson’s return — even in a tough matchup against the Packers in Week 7.

Analysis:
When
Jaylen Warren
was scratched with a knee injury before the Steelers’ Week 4 game against the Vikings in Ireland,
Kenneth Gainwell
stepped in as the starter and had 19-99-2 rushing and 6-35-0 receiving in the Steelers’ 24-21 win, finishing as the RB3 in half-PPR fantasy scoring for the week. Warren will reportedly be back when the Steelers return from their bye to host the Browns in Week 6. Still, Gainwell’s electric performance against Minnesota may have earned him a usage boost going forward. The Browns are a tough matchup this week, but Gainwell could be Flex-worthy in a soft Week 7 matchup against the Bengals. And if Warren’s knee issues linger, Gainwell could become immensely valuable.
Tyler Allgeier (RB – ATL)
: 31% Rostered
Next Opponents
: BUF, @SF, MIA
True Value

Desperate Need
: $8
Budget-Minded
: $3
Analysis:
One of the most valuable handcuffs in fantasy,
Tyler Allgeier
would have immense value if
Bijan Robinson
were to miss time, but Allgeier is already providing something close to standalone value. Through their first four games, the Falcons were the sixth run-heaviest team in the league, running the ball on 48.1% of their offensive snaps. Allgeier has had double-digit carries in three of those games, including a 16-76-1 rushing performance against the Vikings in Week 2 and a 16-51-1 rushing day against the Commanders in Week 4.
Brashard Smith (RB – KC)
: 14% Rostered
Next Opponents
: DET, LV, WSH
True Value
: $4
Desperate Need
: $7
Budget-Minded

Analysis:
Heading into the Chiefs’ Monday-night game against the Jaguars,
Isiah Pacheco
is averaging four yards per carry, hasn’t broken off a run of more than 12 yards and hasn’t rushed for more than 45 yards in a game this season. His backfield platoon partner,
Kareem Hunt
, is averaging 3.2 yards per carry, with his longest run covering 11 yards. The Kansas City backfield could use more juice, and perhaps Brashard Smith can provide it. Smith has 4.39 speed and pass-catching ability. There’s been chatter about Smith getting more work in the weeks to come. There might not be many more chances to acquire him inexpensively.
Kendre Miller (RB – NO)
: 31% Rostered
Next Opponents
: NE, @CHI, TB
True Value
: $4
Desperate Need
: $7
Budget-Minded
: $2
Analysis:
The Saints have ramped up Kendre Miller’s usage over the last two weeks. In Week 4, Miller played 31% of the offensive snaps and had 11-65-1 rushing in the Saints’ loss to the Bills. In Week 5, Miller played 39% of the snaps and had 10-41-0 rushing and 1-8-0 receiving in a win over the Giants. After being plagued by injuries during his first two years in the league, Miller is finally getting a foothold in the Saints’ offense. Miller doesn’t have standalone value yet, because
Alvin Kamara
is still the undisputed lead back in New Orleans, and the Saints don’t have enough offensive punch for two of their backs to be fantasy-viable. But Miller is at least flirting with Flex value, and he’d become quite valuable if anything happened to Kamara. One minor concern is that
Taysom Hill
‘s return to action after last season’s knee injury could put a dent in Miller’s rushing volume. Hill had six carries Sunday in his first game back.
Hassan Haskins (RB – LAC)
: 1% Rostered
Next Opponents
: @MIA, IND, MIN
True Value
: $3
Desperate Need
: $6
Budget-Minded
: $2
Analysis:
Chargers RB
Omarion Hampton
has been placed on injured reserve with a foot injury, leaving the Chargers scrambling to fill the void. Haskins, who played for Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh at the University of Michigan, figures to be part of the replacement plan, though he’s likely to share work with Kimani Vidal and perhaps others. (The Chargers could potentially re-sign Gus Edwards.) The 6-foot-1, 220-pound Haskins is bigger than Vidal and is the best bet to handle goal-line work. In his final college season at Michigan in 2021, Haskins ran for 1,327 yards and 20 touchdowns. But Haskins is a plodder with minimal pass-catching ability, so he’s unlikely to play on passing downs. Haskins is worth an investment if you have a screaming need at running back, but realize that he probably won’t have the backfield to himself while Hampton is out. Also consider that the Chargers’ offensive line has been decimated by injuries.
Kimani Vidal (RB – LAC)
: 0% Rostered
Next Opponents
: @MIA, IND, MIN
True Value
: $3
Desperate Need
: $6
Budget-Minded
: $2
Analysis:
Vidal figures to help fill the hole in the Chargers’ backfield created by the foot injury that landed Omarion Hampton on IR. Vidal and Haskins each played 14 snaps in Week 5. Vidal had 4-18-0 rushing and 1-1-0 receiving on one target. Haskins had 5-13-0 rushing and 1-2-0 receiving on one target. Haskins had out-snapped Vidal 14-2 before Week 5. Vidal, Troy University’s all-time rushing leader, is faster than Haskins and has better pass-catching chops, so there’s a decent chance Vidal will get passing-down work.
Kareem Hunt (RB – KC)
: 39% Rostered
Next Opponents: DET, LV, WSH
True Value
: $1
Desperate Need
: $2
Budget-Minded
: $0
Analysis:
There’s not much of a case to be made that the 30-year-old Kareem Hunt could be a truly valuable fantasy asset this year. He’s averaging 3.2 yards per carry with a long run of 11 yards, and he has five catches in four games. But Hunt is averaging 10.3 touches a game and has been used in goal-line situations this season. A decent workload in a good offense has value during the bye weeks — if only a small degree of value.
Running Back Stash Candidates
Kyle Monangai (RB – CHI)
Tyjae Spears (RB – TEN)
Isaiah Davis (RB – NYJ)
Brian Robinson Jr. (RB – SF)
Bears rookie
Kyle Monangai
runs like his life depends on it. It’s possible he soon makes a serious run at
D’Andre Swift
‘s starting job, and maybe Monangai’s role will expand now that the Bears are coming out of a Week 5 bye. Swift is averaging -0.39 rushing yards over expected per carry, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. He was underwater in rushing yards over expected per carry last year, too, ranking dead last in that category among all qualifying backs. Monangai might constitute an upgrade.
Tyjae Spears
came off the IR in Week 5. He played 17 snaps and had 4-14-0 rushing in the Titans’ upset of the Cardinals. Titans head coach Brian Callahan said during the offseason that he wanted to get Spears more involved. Now that Spears is healthy again and has had a ramp-up game, perhaps he’ll start to carve out a bigger role.
Isaiah Davis
is the top backup to
Breece Hall
now that
Braelon Allen
is expected to miss two months or more with a knee injury. Davis doesn’t have standalone value, but he’s now a valuable handcuff who should probably be rostered in larger leagues.
Brian Robinson Jr.
is a lottery ticket as the handcuff to the oft-injured
Christian McCaffrey
, who’s been carrying an enormous load for the 49ers early this season. Backup running backs have thrived when thrust into temporary starting roles in Kyle Shanahan’s offense.
Wide Receivers

: 30% Rostered
Next Opponents

True Value

Desperate Need

Analysis:
Troy Franklin has two top-36 wide receiver finishes this season (WR7, WR36). He entered Week 5 with a 72.8% route share, a 19.7% target share, a 30.6% air-yard share, 1.78 yards per route run (49 receiving yards per game) and a 21.3% first-read share, per Fantasy Points Data. Franklin walked away from Week 5 with a strong 79% route share, but he only had a 12.8% target share and 35 receiving yards, per Pro Football Focus (PFF). Franklin should provide solid Flex value this week against a Jets secondary that, aside from cornerback
Sauce Gardner
, scares no one. Franklin follows that up with plus matchups against the Giants and Cowboys, who entered Week 5 having given up the most and fifth-most fantasy points per game to perimeter wide receivers, respectively.
Kendrick Bourne (WR – SF)
: 4% Rostered
Next Opponents
: @TB, ATL, @HOU
True Value
: $2
Desperate Need
: $4
Budget-Minded
: $1
Analysis:
If you picked up Kendrick Bourne last week, whether out of desperation or on a hunch with all of the injuries to the 49ers’ receivers, and started him, take a bow. Bourne had a wonderful game in the 49ers’ upset of the Rams. He soaked up a 22.4% target share (11 targets), finishing with 142 receiving yards (3.74 yards per route run) and a 25% first-read share, per Fantasy Points Data. I obviously won’t tell you that Bourne will continue this type of production, but the 49ers’ pass-catchers are severely banged up. Wide receivers
Ricky Pearsall
and
Jauan Jennings
are still nursing injuries, and tight end
George Kittle
is at least another week away from returning. Bourne, at the very least, could be a plug-and-play Flex option this week if Pearsall and Jennings remain out. The Buccaneers’ secondary is dealing with a rash of injuries and just got shredded by
Sam Darnold
and the Seahawks.

True Value

Analysis:
If Darius Slayton is still out there in your league, he should be rostered. No, his stat line from Week 5 wasn’t eye-popping, but the box score lacks some key context from his game against the Saints. Slayton left the fourth quarter of the game with a hamstring issue, so take his 15% target share and 31 receiving yards with a grain of salt. What’s also missing are the big plays that Slayton and
Jaxson Dart
left on the field. Slayton dropped what should have been a chunk gain, and Dart underthrew Slayton on a go ball that would have been a huge play and walk-in touchdown. Slayton has a horrible three-game stretch upcoming. Even if he’s healthy, you’re probably not looking to start him the next three weeks. But after those games, Slayton’s schedule opens up, and he’ll obviously have an enhanced role in the Giants’ passing game with
Malik Nabers
out for the season. If you are looking to stash a possible strong Flex play for Weeks 10-15, Slayton is your guy.

Analysis:
Before Atlanta’s Week 5 bye, Darnell Mooney left the Falcons’ last game with a hamstring injury. He’s expected to be ready to go this week, but we’ll still need to monitor practice reports and the news. Mooney has been dealing with injuries all season, but when he’s on the field, he’s a sizable part of the Falcons’ passing offense. He’s had a 22% target per route run rate and 20.3% first-read share this season, per Fantasy Points Data. With
Michael Penix Jr.
playing better and the Falcons’ passing attack remaining condensed, Mooney still holds volume-based Flex appeal.

Analysis:
Xavier Worthy quickly reminded all of the fantasy community on Sunday afternoon that his health is a moving target, with his status getting downgraded to questionable for Week 5. Worthy is dealing with shoulder and ankle issues. Since Week 2, Marquise Brown has been a volatile player who’s difficult to trust, but his upcoming matchups could help him pay off handsomely for your flex spot. Detroit (10th-most), Las Vegas (eighth-most) and Washington (sixth-most) all sit comfortably inside the top 10 for most PPR points per target allowed to perimeter wide receivers, per Fantasy Points Data.

Analysis:
The former University of Texas speedster has become a full-time player for the Browns with a 19.4% target share and 43.5 receiving yards per game over the last two weeks. I’m not cutting back flips in jubilation to buy into the Cleveland passing attack, but the Browns’ upcoming matchups could help elevate Isaiah Bond into fringe Flex relevance. The Steelers and Dolphins have allowed the 12th-most and ninth-most PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers, respectively, this season.

Analysis:
Christian Kirk
is coming off his best game as a Texan, and it still isn’t much to write home about. He had a 14.8% target share and led the team in receiving yards, but it was still only 64 yards.
C.J. Stroud
played arguably his best game of the season, but considering his body of work to this point of the season, that probably says more about the Ravens’ pass defense than Stroud. Kirk has cemented himself as one of the team’s starting wide receivers and could be a viable Flex option with some big-play potential, as he has been the second option in the deep passing game behind
Nico Collins
. I’m not rushing to play him after the bye, but as far as Flex plays go, you could do worse.
Wide Receiver Stash Candidates
Luther Burden (WR – CHI)
Luther Burden
remains locked in to a ~20% route share behind
Olamide Zaccheaus
. He has made the most of his opportunities with 3.19 yards per route run and 0.76 fantasy points per route run, per Fantasy Points Data, but it’s unclear how long
Ben Johnson
will continue to hold his talented rookie back. He’s worth stashing, because if Johnson ever gets out of the way and unleashes Burden, the talent is there for him to possibly become a mainstay in your fantasy lineup.

Analysis:
Bryce Young is the preferred streaming option at quarterback this week, thanks to a matchup against a Cowboys pass defense capable of making average quarterbacks look like Tom Brady. Young might not even qualify as average, however. He’s averaging 5.4 yards per pass attempt and has topped 200 passing yards in only one of his five games this season. But Young has a Week 6 date with a Dallas defense that’s being torched for 304 passing yards per game this season. The Cowboys have allowed 12 touchdown passes and are yielding 8.4 yards per pass attempt. Young’s matchup against the Jets in Week 7 isn’t a bad one either.

Analysis:
It appears Jaxson Dart is going to provide fantasy managers with consistent rushing value, but his passing output seems destined to be a mixed bag. In his NFL debut in Week 4, Dart completed 13-of-20 passes for 111 yards and a touchdown in the Giants’ upset of the Chargers, adding 10-54-1 rushing. In the Giants’ Week 5 loss to the Saints, Dart was 26-of-40 through the air for 202 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. He also had 7-55-0 rushing. So far, Dart is averaging just 5.2 yards per pass attempt, which isn’t pretty. Of course, Dart also lost his best receiver,
Malik Nabers
, to a season-ending knee injury during Dart’s first professional start. The schedule lays down a gauntlet for Dart these next three weeks, with two games against the Eagles and one against the Broncos. In Weeks 9 and 10, he’ll get easier matchups against the 49ers and Bears. Dart is worth rostering but perhaps not worth starting for a few weeks.

After being pulled from a nightmarish start against the Panthers in Week 3, Michael Penix Jr. rebounded by completing 20-of-26 passes for 313 yards, two touchdowns and one interception in the Falcons’ Week 4 win over the Commanders. The rifle-armed Penix has playable matchups against the Bills and 49ers the next two weeks before getting a smash matchup with the Dolphins in Week 8. Alas, Penix doesn’t offer much in the way of rushing value. In seven career starts, he has 42 rushing yards and two touchdown runs.

Tua Tagovailoa has played well over his last two starts, with an efficient 177 passing yards and two touchdowns against the Jets in Week 4, and 256 yards and three touchdowns against the Panthers in Week 5. Granted, those are relatively soft matchups, but Tagovailoa has now thrown multiple touchdown passes in four consecutive games. You could use Tagovailoa in a pinch this week against the Chargers, but you might want to sit him against the Browns in Week 7.

Spencer Rattler continues to acquit himself well, minimizing big mistakes and keeping the Saints competitive in games. He’s certainly not a front-runner for MVP, but Rattler has thrown for at least 200 yards in four of his five starts, and his 7:3 touchdown-to-interception ratio is respectable. Rattler offers some value with his legs, rushing for 123 yards so far. Favorable matchups against the Patriots, Bears and Buccaneers the next three weeks make Rattler a viable streaming option in October.

Analysis:
Mason Taylor finally had the breakout game I’d been waiting for in Week 4. He followed it up with a
monster
outing in Week 5. In Week 4, Taylor was the TE11 in fantasy, soaking up a 25.9% target share with 65 receiving yards (2.50 yards per route run) and a 33.3% first-read share, per Fantasy Points Data. In Week 5 against Dallas, he had a 26% target share with nine receptions and 67 receiving yards. He led the Jets in targets, cementing his status as the team’s clear No. 2 option in the passing game behind
Garrett Wilson
. Taylor offers TE1 plug-and-play value. Yes, this week’s matchup against Denver is tough, but he follows that up with cakewalks against Carolina and Cincinnati before the Jets’ bye week. If you are dealing with some frustrating veteran such as
T.J. Hockenson
or
Mark Andrews
at tight end, you should be rostering Taylor. He could be a more consistent volume earner and producer moving forward.

Against the Vikings on Sunday, he had only a 12.1% target share with 13 receiving yards and a touchdown. The score saved his fantasy day. Fannin could enjoy a nice run in the next three weeks, with dates against the Steelers, Dolphins and Patriots.

Theo Johnson has scored three touchdowns over his last two games. Will he keep up that pace the rest of the season? Of course not, but that doesn’t mean he can’t be a strong streaming option at tight end moving forward.

Analysis:
The Seahawks had to take to the air in Week 5 to try to keep pace with the Buccaneers. AJ Barner had the best game of his career, securing all seven of his targets (21.8% target share) for 53 receiving yards and a score. Barner has played at least 80% of the snaps in four out of five games this season, so he is clearly the Seahawks’ starting tight end. He’ll be game script sensitive moving forward, as the Seahawks do not want to pass a ton unless their hand is forced. Barner could still return streaming value, as his touchdown equity in this offense is real, with four scores in his last four games.

Analysis:
The Patriots’ defense has been better in the fantasy realm than in reality so far this season. New England’s defense entered Week 5 tied for seventh in fantasy scoring but 28th in
DVOA
(defense-adjusted value over average). It might not be a top-shelf unit, but the Patriots’ defense should continue to produce fantasy points throughout October thanks to a string of soft matchups. The Pats face the Saints, Titans and Browns the next three weeks. Barring an unforeseen quarterback change, the most experienced quarterback the Patriots will face during that stretch will be second-year Saints signal-caller
Spencer Rattler
, who’s made 11 NFL starts. Consider spending an extra buck on the New England defense and riding it for the next three weeks.

Analysis:
The Raiders are on a four-game losing streak and coming off a 40-6 obliteration at the hands of the Colts. Las Vegas has given up 106 points over its last three games. So, what’s appealing about the Raiders’ defense? It’s a Week 6 matchup against the Titans, whose offense has been an abomination so far this season. The Titans have scored 76
points over their first five games. Rookie quarterback
Cam Ward
has been sacked 19 times, has thrown three interceptions and has coughed up two fumbles.
As mediocre as the Raiders’ defense has been, it’s a perfectly reasonable streaming option for Week 6.
Indianapolis Colts: 48% Rostered

Analysis:
The Colts’ defense has been a surprisingly fantasy-friendly unit. It entered Week 5 ranked sixth in defensive fantasy scoring and then held the Raiders to six points on Sunday, sacking quarterback
Geno Smith
four times and forcing him into two interceptions. The Colts are a playable Week 6 option at home in a neutral matchup against the Cardinals.

Analysis:
Entering its Monday-night game against Kansas City, the Jacksonville defense has produced double-digit fantasy points in three of its first four games and entered Week 5 ranked second in fantasy scoring behind only Seattle, which happens to be Jacksonville’s opponent this week. The Seahawks haven’t been an especially great matchup for fantasy defenses since Seattle is so run-heavy. But the Jaguars have shown a knack for takeaways, forcing a league-high 13 turnovers through their first four games.
Kickers

Chris Boswell (K – PIT)
: 45% Rostered

: CLE, @CIN, GB
True Value

Analysis:
The most underrated component of evaluating kickers for fantasy is the willingness of individual head coaches to settle for field goals. You’d think Detroit’s
Jake Bates
would be a top fantasy kicker because the Lions score so many points. But Lions head coach Dan Campbell is perhaps the most aggressive coach in the league when it comes to going for it on fourth down, which robs Bates of field goal opportunities. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin, on the other hand, doesn’t mind settling for three points. Although Chris Boswell has attempted only seven field goals in his first four games of 2025, he had 44 field goal attempts in 2024. Only
Brandon Aubrey
of the Cowboys had more. It’s hard to score touchdowns on the Cleveland defense, so Boswell might be called upon several times when the Steelers host the Browns in Week 6.

Analysis:
Jason Myers is averaging 10.6 fantasy points per game and gets playable matchups against the Jaguars and Texans the next two weeks. Seattle’s offense has been on fire, with the Seahawks averaging 33.3 points per game since Week 2.

: 12% Rostered

Analysis:
The Raiders’ offense could muster only six points against the Colts in Week 5, with Daniel Carlson banging home short field goals of 24 and 37 yards. There should be greater scoring potential for Carlson and the Raiders this week in a home game against the Titans. Tennessee has allowed 28.2 points a game
and has given up at least 20 points in every contest.

Analysis:
Before putting in a claim on Matt Prater, check the status of Bills kicker
Tyler Bass
, who’s been on the IR with a hip/groin injury. Bass was eligible to come off IR in Week 5, but the Bills have not yet opened his window to return. The 41-year-old Prater is 10-of-11 on field goals and 15-of-15 on extra points this season
and has an attractive Week 6 matchup against the Falcons in a dome.

Analysis:
The Packers have been having issues with blocked kicks, but Brandon McManus is still a strong streaming option this week in a home game against the stumbling Bengals.
Fool’s Gold
Xavier Hutchinson (WR – HOU)
Tre Tucker (WR – LV)
Ryan Flournoy (WR – DAL)
Xavier Hutchinson
had two touchdowns in the Texans’ 44-10 destruction of the injury-plagued Ravens, but he was targeted only three times and had just 18 receiving yards. Although Hutchinson actually led Houston receivers in Week 5 snaps (47) and tied
Nico Collins
for the team lead in routes run (25), the Texans’ passing game hasn’t been productive enough to make any Houston pass-catcher other than Collins startable. Plus, Hutchinson may lose snaps to one or both of the Texans’ two rookie receivers,
Jayden Higgins
and
Jaylin Noel
, in the coming weeks.
A popular pickup after his eight-catch, 145-yard, three-touchdown game against the Commanders in Week 3,
Tre Tucker
has had 6-75-0 on eight targets in the two games since. Tucker might draw some interest after having a team-high 62 receiving yards in Week 5, but star tight end
Brock Bowers
was out on Sunday, and Tucker has had an unimpressive 14% target share the last two weeks. Tucker was among the league leaders in routes run in 2024 and produced only 47-539-3 receiving.
Ryan Flournoy
was the Cowboys’ leading receiver in their win over the Jets on Sunday, catching six passes for 114 yards on nine targets. In 15 previous NFL games, Flournoy had 14 catches for 137 yards and no touchdowns. He may continue to contribute until
CeeDee Lamb
comes back from an ankle injury, or until
KaVontae Turpin
returns from a foot injury, but it would be difficult to trust Flournoy in your lineup this week.
Drop Recommendations
Droppable
Jerry Jeudy (WR – CLE)
Jalen Tolbert (WR – DAL)
Chris Rodriguez (RB – WSH)
Jeremy McNichols (RB – WSH)
Jerry Jeudy
has 6-80-0 receiving on 19 targets over his last three games. Although third-round rookie quarterback
Dillon Gabriel
acquitted himself well on Sunday in his first NFL start, the lack of juice in the Cleveland passing game renders Jeudy unplayable for fantasy.
Some fantasy managers picked up Cowboys wide receiver
Jalen Tolbert
, thinking he might have Flex-type value while
CeeDee Lamb
is out with an ankle injury. But Lamb won’t be out much longer, and Tolbert hasn’t been especially productive in the two games Lamb has missed. Tolbert had 4-61-0 receiving on six targets versus the Packers in Week 4, but he was held without a catch against the Jets in Week 5 and had only one target, even though teammate
George Pickens
was locking horns with Jets cornerback
Sauce Gardner
most of the day. Tolbert can be dropped.
Jacory Croskey-Merritt
seized control of the Washington backfield with 150 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns in the Commanders’ Week 5 win over the Chargers, leaving
Chris Rodriguez
and
Jeremy McNichols
unworthy of roster spots on fantasy teams.
Droppable With a Chance of Regret
T.J. Hockenson (TE – MIN)
Juwan Johnson (TE – NO)
T.J. Hockenson
is accumulating receptions but not doing much with them. The veteran tight end has 19 catches for 153 yards and a touchdown. Hockenson’s ceiling is limited, considering that the Vikings have been getting mediocre quarterback play from
J.J. McCarthy
and
Carson Wentz
and that Hockenson has to share targets with receivers
Justin Jefferson
and
Jordan Addison
. Hockenson has low-level fantasy value, but if you’ve found a better solution at tight end (like
Darren Waller
, for instance), you might be able to drop Hockenson for a more useful contributor.
Juwan Johnson
was a thing early in the season, but he’s had five receptions for 45 yards in his last two games, and his appeal is lessened by the return of Saints tight ends
Taysom Hill
and
Foster Moreau
, who had been out with injuries. Johnson is borderline rosterable.
Don’t Drop Yet
Woody Marks (RB – HOU)
Zach Ertz (TE – WSH)
Tee Higgins (WR – CIN)
Woody Marks
was a wildly popular
waiver wire
pickup last week after playing more snaps than fellow Texans running back
Nick Chubb
in Week 4 and totaling 119 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns against the Titans. But Marks was unable to capitalize on a matchup against the injury-depleted Baltimore defense in Week 5, carrying the ball seven times for 24 yards and failing to catch his one target. Chubb had the better day against the Ravens, rushing 11 times for 61 yards and a touchdown. But Marks out-snapped Chubb again in Week 5, this time by a 27-24 margin. Resist the temptation to bail out on Marks after a disappointing performance.
Zach Ertz
has 5-59-0 receiving on seven targets over his last three games and didn’t have a catch in the Commanders’ Week 5 win over the Chargers. But Commanders quarterback
Jayden Daniels
missed two of those games, and Daniels threw only 26 passes in Week 5. Hold Ertz for favorable matchups against the Bears and Cowboys the next two weeks.
The
Joe Burrow
injury obviously diminishes the fantasy value of
Tee Higgins
, but not to the extent that you should cut him. Bench him? Fine. But Higgins is too talented to walk the plank despite the Bengals’ myriad of offensive problems.
