==================================================

While we still have the showdown between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Kansas City Chiefs on Monday Night Football to close out Week 5, it’s time to look ahead at the
waiver wire
to find players to start or stash.
See my top picks coming out of the Sunday slate ahead of Week 6.

Fantasy Football Waiver Wire Targets & Stashes
All players listed below are rostered in 30% or fewer of Yahoo! leagues.
WR Handcuffs, Targets & Stashes
Isaiah Bond WR – CLE)
| 6% Rostered
Over the last two weeks, Isaiah Bond has garnered a 19.7% target share on the Browns, trailing only
Jerry Jeudy
‘s 21.2%. This is a positive sign as the Browns started
Joe Flacco
in Week 4 and have now moved on to
Dillon Gabriel
.
In Week 5 in London, Bond was second on the team in target share (21.9%), but he only caught two of his seven targets for 29 yards. The targets are there, and they should turn into more chances to rack up points.
Christian Watson (WR – GB)
| 5% Rostered
Christian Watson has been designated to return from the reserve/PUP list and is back at practice. The Packers now have a 21-day window to activate him.
Of course, add Watson with caution. This is a player notorious for getting injured, but if you have some space on the back of your bench and you’re still able to slide him into an injured reserve (IR) spot, you could do a lot worse than a player with the type of speed and explosion Watson provides.
Troy Franklin (WR – DEN)
| 30% Rostered
Troy Franklin has carved out the No. 2 WR role in Denver. He has a 19% target share, which is second on the team to
Courtland Sutton
(22%). Franklin has caught 21 of his 32 targets for 231 yards and a touchdown. He has seen five targets or more in four out of five games.
The touchdowns are going to be pretty hit or miss, but Franklin is a solid addition to PPR rosters.
Kendrick Bourne (WR – SF)
| 4% Rostered
With the plethora of injuries on the 49ers’ roster, Kendrick Bourne stepped up in the overtime win against the Rams, catching 10 passes on 11 targets for 142 yards. While it’s hard to expect that again, he is tied for second on the roster in target share (14.9%). Bourne is worth an add.
Tory Horton (WR – SEA)
| 6% Rostered
If you’re looking for a touchdown-dependent pure wide receiver handcuff, give Tory Horton a look. He has yet to cross 39 yards in a game, but he has scored three touchdowns.
TE
Handcuffs, Targets & Stashes
Harold Fannin Jr. (TE – CLE)
| 27% Rostered
Harold Fannin Jr. saw a noticeable rostership dip, but as we saw in Week 5, he’ll still get some looks. In his first game with Dillon Gabriel, he caught four passes for 13 yards and a touchdown.
Fellow tight end
David Njoku
dominated the target share (28.1%), but Fannin isn’t completely gone. He’s not a weekly starter, but definitely belongs on a bench.
Dalton Schultz (TE – HOU)
| 24% Rostered
If you’re in a PPR league, you need Dalton Schultz on your team. He’s second on the Texans in target share (18.6%) and has caught five passes in three straight games. If you’re looking for a fill-in tight end or a back-end Flex, he’s a pretty fair bet for 8-10 weekly points.
Theo Johnson (WR – TE)
| 11% Rostered
Over the last two weeks with
Jaxson Dart
as the starting quarterback, Theo Johnson has a 20.3% target share, which is tied with
Wan’Dale Robinson
. He’s caught nine passes on 12 targets for 50 yards and three touchdowns. In Week 5, he caught six passes for 33 yards and two touchdowns. Johnson is one of Dart’s favorite targets.
Mason Taylor (WT – NYJ)
| 13% Rostered
The Jets have needed another receiving option in addition to
Garrett Wilson
, and it appears they may have one with Mason Taylor. In Week 5, Mason led the team in target share at 27.3%, catching nine passes on 12 targets for 67 yards.
Across the entire season, Taylor is second in target share (18.9%) on the team, behind Wilson’s staggering 32.4%.
Jake Tonges (TE – SF)
| 4% Rostered
Jake Tonges has been on a bit of a roll lately. Over the last two weeks, he’s second on the team in target share (18.8%), catching 10 passes for 99 yards and two touchdowns. He’s caught a touchdown in back-to-back games. Again, with how injured this roster is, you might as well take advantage now.
AJ Barner (TE – SEA)
| 2% Rostered
In a 38-35 shootout, AJ Barner caught seven passes for 53 yards and two touchdowns. He’s now scored four times in four games. Like Tory Horton, he may be more touchdown-dependent, but Barner is worth a bench spot and is a solid spot starter during a bye week.
