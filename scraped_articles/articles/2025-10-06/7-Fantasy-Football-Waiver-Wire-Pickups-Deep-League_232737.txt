==================================================

Doing your weekly waivers in fantasy football can be more stressful than performing life-saving surgery on a loved one without any professional tools or medical knowledge. While that might be a slight exaggeration, deciding which players to add off the waiver wire each week can be stressful.
Finding and adding the right guys in shallow leagues is simple, as there are plenty of appealing options, and the waiver wire is full of talent. Unfortunately, making your waiver wire claims in deeper leagues can be a massive pain in the neck.
However, I’m here to help by giving fantasy players seven waiver wire targets they should add in deeper leagues in Week 6.

Deep League Fantasy Football Waiver Wire Targets
All the players in this article are rostered in under 25% of ESPN leagues.
Dillon Gabriel (QB – CLE)
: 2.2% Rostered
Despite facing a talented Minnesota Vikings defense, Gabriel played well in his first NFL start. He had 190 passing yards, two touchdowns, and 16.1 fantasy points in the loss. More importantly, fantasy players with
Josh Allen
or
Lamar Jackson
on their rosters should add him off the waiver wire this week. The rookie faces the Miami Dolphins in Week 7 when the superstars have their bye. Miami has surrendered 1.8 passing touchdowns and 23.6 fantasy points per game to quarterbacks this season. Gabriel could have a top-10 finish that week.
Kendre Miller (RB – NO)
: 20.9% Rostered
While
Alvin Kamara
remains New Orleans’ No. 1 running back, Miller has carved out a consistent role. After totaling 17 rushing attempts for 59 yards and 10 PPR fantasy points over the first three weeks, he has 21 attempts for 106 yards and 18.4 fantasy points over the past two games, totaling double-digit attempts in both contests. More importantly, Miller had more rushing attempts than Kamara (10 vs. 8) in the win over the New York Giants on Sunday. Furthermore, Kamara could get traded before the deadline next month.
Kendrick Bourne (WR – SF)
: 6.5% Rostered
Hopefully, the 49ers get
Ricky Pearsall
,
Jauan Jennings
, and
George Kittle
back from injury in Week 6. However, Bourne should be added in all leagues this week in case the three star players don’t return. Last week, the veteran stepped up for San Francisco, leading the team in receptions (10), targets (11), receiving yards (142), and PPR fantasy points (24.2) in the win over the Los Angeles Rams. Bourne is an excellent bye week replacement for fantasy players missing
Nico Collins
,
Justin Jefferson
, or
Jordan Addison
in Week 6.
Isaiah Bond (WR – CLE)
: 4.6% Rostered
It’s a new offense in Cleveland with Dillon Gabriel taking over under center, making Bond one of my favorite waiver wire adds this week. He is filling in for
Cedric Tillman
, who is on injured reserve with a hamstring injury. Bond had only two receptions for 29 receiving yards and 4.9 PPR fantasy points in Week 5. However, the former Texas star finished second on the team in targets (seven) behind
David Njoku
(nine). More importantly, Bond had more targets than the rest of the Browns’ wide receivers combined (six).
Ryan Flournoy (WR – DAL)
: 0.1% Rostered
Fantasy players shouldn’t use much of their FAAB on Flournoy, as the Cowboys could get
CeeDee Lamb
and/or
KaVontae Turpin
back from injury in Week 6. However, he stepped up against the New York Jets, totaling six receptions on nine targets for 114 receiving yards and 18.4 PPR fantasy points, setting career-highs in every category. More importantly, Flournoy led Dallas in every metric, seeing five more targets than
George Pickens
(four). He is a potential flex option next week against the Carolina Panthers if Lamb and Turpin don’t play.
Mason Taylor (TE – NYJ)
: 8.1% Rostered
Taylor was one of my favorite waiver wire adds last week following his performance against the Miami Dolphins. The rookie had five receptions on seven targets for 65 receiving yards and 11.5 PPR fantasy points against the division rivals. More importantly, he had another impressive outing Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys, totaling nine receptions on 12 targets for 67 receiving yards and 17.7 fantasy points. Taylor has more targets over the past two weeks than
Garrett Wilson
(19 vs. 18). He is the No. 2 option in the passing game.
Theo Johnson (TE – NYG)
: 5.5% Rostered
The Giants are looking for options in the passing game with
Malik Nabers
suffering a season-ending torn ACL. While everyone assumes a wide receiver will step up for the superstar, Johnson has been New York’s best pass catcher over the past two weeks. The former Penn State star has nine receptions on 12 targets for 50 receiving yards, three touchdowns, and 32 PPR fantasy points in
Jaxson Dart
’s two starts, totaling 10.7 or more in both contests. More importantly, he has a team-high 20% target share with Dart starting.
