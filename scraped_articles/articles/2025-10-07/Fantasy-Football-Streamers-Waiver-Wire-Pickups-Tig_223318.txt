==================================================

The tight end position matters greatly in fantasy football. Tight ends are not as flashy as their route-running counterparts at wide receiver. Most of them do not normally get the same volume of touches as fantasy-relevant running backs. That can sometimes lead to them being overlooked or treated as an afterthought. Do not make that mistake.
The tight end pool is the shallowest of them all in terms of fantasy. Finding production there weekly can be incredibly challenging, especially for those who did not invest in one of the top options during draft season.
One way to find success at the position is by carefully playing the
waiver wire
week-to-week. The goal of this weekly article is to help fantasy managers do just that by finding low-rostered tight ends in the best situations for that particular week.

Week 6 Fantasy Football Tight End Streamers & Waiver Wire Pickups
The following tight ends are rostered in fewer than 75% of Yahoo! leagues.
Evan Engram (TE – DEN)
vs. NYJ | 48% Rostered
Evan Engram missed Week 3 due to a back injury. Since then, the Broncos have made it a point to get the two-time Pro-Bowler his share of looks in the passing game.
Bo Nix
connected with the veteran tight end four times on seven targets for 29 yards in Week 4. During this past Sunday’s comeback win over the Eagles, Engram hauled in another four passes for 33 yards and his first score of the season.

The Broncos travel to London this week to face the Jets, who have allowed an NFL-worst five touchdowns to opposing tight ends. Four of those scores have come in the last two games. Engram has a good shot to find the end zone again.
Mason Taylor (TE – NYJ)
vs. DEN | 14% Rostered
On the other side of the game in the U.K. this Sunday, Evan Engram’s rookie counterpart has settled into the league over the past couple of weeks. Mason Taylor finished Week 5’s loss to the Cowboys with the most targets (12) and receptions (nine) on the Jets, coming in just four yards behind wide receiver
Garrett Wilson
with 67 yards. It was the second game in a row with 65+ yards for the second-round pick out of LSU.
The Broncos feature a much stronger defense than the Cowboys, but the Denver unit did allow Philly tight end
Dallas Goedert
into the end zone in Week 5. Taylor has yet to score his first NFL touchdown, but he did come up with two receptions inside the red zone this past Sunday.
Jake Tonges (TE – SF)
at TB | 4% Rostered
Jake Tonges hit paydirt in his third different game out of the past five last Thursday in L.A.
Tonges TD!
Mac Jones goes 5/5 on the opening drive to get the
@49ers
on the board.

Tonges has come out of nowhere to turn into a crucial part of the 49ers’ passing attack in
George Kittle
‘s (hamstring) absence. Head coach Kyle Shanahan suggested late last week that
Kittle returning for Week 6 is a “longshot,”
meaning Tonges should be the top tight end on the depth chart for at least one more game.
The Buccaneers have surrendered four scores to the tight end position so far this season, including two to Seattle’s
AJ Barner
on Sunday. Tonges finished with a career-high seven grabs on 11 targets for 41 yards in the win over the Rams last week. Regardless of who starts at quarterback for the 49ers, Tonges is likely to be very involved once again.
