==================================================

It’s Week 6, and by now, fantasy football managers have either found their rhythm or are quietly pretending that 1-4 is “just bad luck.” The
waiver wire
is thinning, trade deadlines are creeping closer, and every decision feels like the hinge between playoff glory and another “next year” speech. That’s where our Featured Pros come in — here to help you spot the buy-low gems and sell-high mirages before your league mates do. Let’s dive into who’s trending the wrong way (and why that’s a good thing) — and which players’ stats might be about to come crashing down.

Players to Buy Low & Sell High in Week 6
Buy Low
Who is your favorite buy-low trade candidate heading into Week 6 and why? Also, who are you willing to give up for him?
Derrick Henry (RB – BAL)
“My favorite buy-low candidate is
Derrick Henry
. While he has had a rough start to the season, Baltimore’s schedule gets much easier down the stretch after their Week 7 bye. I think you could probably get him for a guy like
Woody Marks
right now. While Marks is getting the majority of snaps in Houston, he doesn’t get enough consistent carries to be able to be counted on every week like King Henry will.”
–
Trevor Land
(

“
Derrick Henry
is my player of the week to buy-low after a very disappointing performance in Week 5, an obvious result of the Ravens’ offensive struggles and the absence of
Lamar Jackson
through injury. The downturn in production will only be a short-term thing, and it’s the perfect window that savvy managers should exploit. With Jackson expected back after their week 7 bye, this should give Henry a more appealing game script in the second half of the season.”
–
Luke Renton
(
The Franchise Tag UK
)
“
Derrick Henry
might be the best buy-low available. Everything has been negative, so far: three fumbles in the first three weeks, front-loaded schedule,
Lamar Jackson
injury. The Ravens need to get on track fast, and riding one of the best remaining players is the surest way to do that. In 2024, when the Ravens were favorites, Henry averaged 118.9 rush yards per game and scored 14 times on the ground in 15 games. Look to trade away a productive, but not elite WR (
Tre Tucker
,
Rashid Shaheed
,
Marvin Harrison Jr.
, or
DK Metcalf
), and get Henry as your RB1 for your stretch run.”
– Will Urion (
FantasyNow+
)
“
Derrick Henry
has been a victim of how decimated the Baltimore Ravens have been via injuries. It has been rough, but how can anyone actually say Henry won’t bounce back? The Ravens have been losing games, and we know by now that if the Ravens are down, Henry more likely than not won’t be on the field in passing situations. While it may not be much better this week versus the Rams, the Ravens are afforded a Week 7 bye that will help this team get closer to full strength. Teams that are struggling with Henry may not have two weeks to wait around, so the opportunity to buy Henry is right now for teams that are above .500 headed into Week 6. Dealing
Jordan Mason
,
Quinshon Judkins
, or
Stefon Diggs
on a high, would be excellent business to land The King.”
–
Ed Birdsall
(
Talking Points Sports
)
“Can’t really do much with the Ravens but hold their guys. They will likely get destroyed again next week at home versus the Rams if they remain as injured as they currently are. The latest is that
Lamar Jackson
has an “outside shot” of playing in Week 6. Hopefully,
Lamar Jackson
can come healthy out of the Week 7 bye week. But post-bye week… It’s a SMASH spot for the Ravens offense – specifically with
Derrick Henry
. Bears/Dolphins. Sharp managers should be looking to buy low on Henry (presuming they have positive records and don’t need the King over the next few games).”
–
Andrew Erickson

Tetairoa McMillan (WR – TEN)
“Unfortunately,
Tetairoa McMillan
hasn’t lived up to his fantasy draft hype, averaging 11.8 PPR fantasy points per game this season. However, better days are ahead for the rookie. While
Xavier Legette
and
Mitchell Evans
caught
Bryce Young
‘s two passing touchdowns on Sunday against the Miami Dolphins, McMillan remains the quarterback’s go-to target. The former Arizona star had eight targets, twice as many as anyone else on the team. Furthermore, the rest of Carolina’s wide receiver core had 10 targets in Week 5. McMillan’s 29.6% target share and 36.9% receiving yards share led the team for the fifth consecutive game. Once he starts to connect with Young in the end zone, McMillan will produce like a top-15 wide receiver. I would happily sell high on
Michael Pittman Jr.
to land the former Arizona star.”
–
Mike Fanelli
(
FantasyPros
)
TreVeyon Henderson (RB – NE)
“
TreVeyon Henderson
– The talented rookie is averaging less than ten touches per game.
Antonio Gibson
is lost for the season, and
Rhamondre Stevenson
has lost three fumbles in five games. As Mike Vrabel gets more comfortable with Henderson, the usage should increase, particularly in the passing game. Perhaps
Keenan Allen
could net you Henderson and a lower-tier wide receiver.”
– Ryan Lester (Lesters Legends)
Ladd McConkey (WR – LAC)
“Now is the perfect time to target
Ladd McConkey
before his role in the Chargers’ offense takes off. He ranks third on the team in target share, separated by only about 5% from
Keenan Allen
and
Quentin Johnston
. The gap is even tighter in first-read share. With Hampton on IR and LT
Joe Alt
injured, Herbert will need to get the ball out quickly, which plays right into McConkey’s strengths. That makes him a prime buy-low candidate before his usage expands. I would target a trade giving up
Jaylen Waddle
,
George Pickens
, or
DK Metcalf
.”
–
Kyle Zeigler
(
Fantasy In Frames
)
Quentin Johnston (WR – LAC)
“
Quentin Johnston
started the season on fire and came back to earth in Week 5 against a Washington team that was excited to get their leader back and rolled the Chargers. Johnston has scored in three of the four weeks this year and has had over 10 targets in weeks 3 and 4. The Chargers’ passing game had a rough week, which could help owners upgrade their wide receivers by trading with an owner who was disappointed this week. Offer a player coming off a hot week, like
Rashid Shaheed
, and enjoy the bounce-back in week 6 against a putrid Miami defense.”
–
Adam Dove
(

Terry McLaurin (WR – WAS)
“
Terry McLaurin
should be back from a quad injury soon, and his quarterback,
Jayden Daniels
, just returned from a minor knee injury. McLaurin was off to a slow start even before the injury, so his perceived value is at a low ebb. We’ve seen what sort of potential McLaurin has when paired with Daniels. Scary Terry finished WR6 last year in half-point PPR scoring. Maybe the arrival of
Deebo Samuel
has lowered McLaurin’s ceiling, but he’s still capable of being a top-20 fantasy receiver, and you might be able to get him for a time-share running back such as
Woody Marks
or
Rhamondre Stevenson
.”
–
Pat Fitzmaurice
(
FantasyPros

Alvin Kamara (RB – NO)
“
Alvin Kamara
is a risky player who can quickly become a league winner. This season, Kamara has shown that he is still an effective NFL back with incredible contact balance. However, the Saints are in no position to have the veteran as their lead back. All reports are that teams are acquiring about Kamara, and the Saints’ increased usage of
Kendre Miller
seemingly confirms it. If Kamara gets moved, it’ll be to a contender. Notable contending teams that could use a running back upgrade include the Chiefs, Bears, and Chargers. If you have a winning record and are confident in your team, Kamara is a player who could become a league winner overnight. I’d be willing to move a player like Pollard, Skattebo, or Dobbins for him.”
– Ellis Johnson (
FantasyPros

Sell High
Who is your favorite sell-high candidate after Week 6 and why? Also, who would you try to get in return?
Rico Dowdle (RB – CAR)
“
Rico Dowdle’s
32-point, 206-yard performance in Week 5 is the perfect Sell High window. This career game was purely down to a spike in volume off the back of
Chuba Hubbard
‘s calf injury, who the Panthers have made clear they do not plan to put on IR. This suggests Hubbard’s absence will only be for a few weeks at most, and Dowdle’s relevance will only be a short-term thing. Yes, he could earn a slightly increased role, but Dowdle will not suddenly become a workhorse back for the Panthers; this career game is just smoke and mirrors. I would look to trade him away off the back of this outlier performance for a more stable, high-volume player with a historic, less “sexy” appeal, such as
Javonte Williams
or
Travis Etienne
! ”
–
Luke Renton
(
The Franchise Tag UK
)
“
Rico Dowdle
was THE MAN in week 5, rushing for 206 yards and scoring a touchdown. The problem is that Carolina doesn’t play Miami every week, and Chuba will return. Dowdle’s value will never be higher. He is one of those challenging choices for owners because running back is a position that is not nearly as deep as wide receiver, but owners need to know when to sell a player, especially a player who will never have a week like this. Best-case scenario, he is a committee back with
Chuba Hubbard
. Trade him now to a running-back-needy team in a package for an undervalued wide receiver upgrade like
Ricky Pearsall
or (if sneaky and lucky)
Rashee Rice
and, possibly, a low-end short-term running back fill-in like
Michael Carter
or even a committee back like
Tyjae Spears
.”
–
Adam Dove
(
The Fantasy Couriers

Darren Waller (TE – MIA)
“
Darren Waller
has been outstanding for fantasy players after missing the first three games because of a hip injury. The veteran tight end had two receiving touchdowns on only four targets, scoring 17.7 PPR fantasy points against the New York Jets in Week 4. Furthermore, he caught all five targets for 78 receiving yards and a touchdown over Miami’s first three drives on Sunday, totaling 18.8 fantasy points. However, Waller didn’t see the ball again the rest of the game. More importantly, he finished tied for third on the team in targets (five) with
Malik Washington
and backup tight end
Julian Hill
. Meanwhile, it’s only a matter of time until Waller misses time, given his extensive injury history. I would happily trade him for
Mason Taylor
or
Dalton Kincaid
.”
–
Mike Fanelli
(
FantasyPros
)
Romeo Doubs (WR – GB)
“
Romeo Doubs
has four touchdowns in the past three games, but has not topped 68 yards, and has only one game with four or more receptions. He only had four TDs last year, scoring a pair in two games. Doubs topped 70 yards twice last year, with two games with five or more receptions. He’s hit or miss. Perhaps you can deal or package him for rookies
Matthew Golden
or
Travis Hunter
, who have not lived up to expectations yet.”
– Ryan Lester (Lesters Legends)
Emeka Egbuka (WR – TB)
“If I can trade away
Emeka Egbuka
before he comes down to earth, I am absolutely doing it. The PPR WR3 has scored 5 times on only 25 catches. He’s been the beneficiary of multiple broken coverage big plays, and he has had no competition for targets.
Mike Evans
will be back soon,
Chris Godwin
is ramping up,
Jalen McMillan
will be coming off IR, and
Bucky Irving
will be back at some point. See if you can get someone who is actually getting the usage to back up their production:
Jaxon Smith-Njigba
or Garret Wilson, and let regression do the rest.”
–
Will Urion
(
FantasyNow+
)
DK Metcalf (WR – SEA)
“One of my favorite sell-high candidates right now is
DK Metcalf
(WR, Pittsburgh). He’s scored in three straight games, including a big 23.6 fantasy point output. That kind of streak tends to attract prospective managers to trade with. This is the best week to hype up
DK Metcalf
if you are looking to trade him. The Steelers’ passing offense has been mediocre at best. So his stock is likely nearer to a peak than a sustainable baseline, making this a smart time to try to flip him. Because Metcalf still carries upside and name recognition, you should aim to extract something valuable in return. Here are trade targets I’d push for (depending on your roster needs): A steadier WR2 or high-upside WR3 who offers more consistent target volume. A back-end RB2 / flex with decent floor. Happy trading!”
–

Jake Ferguson (TE – DAL)
“I’m looking at
Jake Ferguson
, currently the TE1 in fantasy scoring, and it’s time to strike while the iron is hot. When
CeeDee Lamb
returns from his high ankle sprain in a couple of weeks, he’ll resume his role as the alpha in this offense. In Weeks 1 and 2, when Lamb was active, he commanded a target share 7% higher than Ferguson. Ferguson remains a reliable TE, but expect his production to settle closer to a mid-tier option once Lamb is back. I’d trade him for
Tyler Warren
or
Rashee Rice
if that manager is struggling, or even
Rhamondre Stevenson
, since, whether we like it or not, he’s the RB1. Then I’d grab
Mason Taylor
off waivers, who is widely available.”
–
Kyle Zeigler
(
Fantasy In Frames
)
Alvin Kamara (RB – NO)
“
Alvin Kamara
is averaging 3.9 yards per carry, has scored one touchdown, and hasn’t given us his usual level of pass-catching production (17-77-0 on 21 targets). That doesn’t sound like a sell-high candidate, does it? Well, Kamara is still regarded as the lead back in New Orleans, but the Saints have been ramping up
Kendre Miller
‘s usage, and this seems to be moving toward a two-headed backfield. Kamara’s value could fall further. If you have the RB depth to spare, it might be worth dealing Kamara to an RB-needy team in exchange for an underachieving receiver such as
Ladd McConkey
or
Jakobi Meyers
.”
–
Pat Fitzmaurice
(
FantasyPros
)
Michael Carter (RB – ARI)
“After establishing himself as the clear RB1 for the Arizona Cardinals in Week 5,
Michael Carter
is an easy sell. The window of opportunity for Carter exists for only a short time, as
Trey Benson
will inevitably return for the Cardinals and assume his duties as the lead back in the absence of
James Conner
. Carter dominated the early-down opportunities for Arizona on Sunday, accumulating 32 1st and 2nd down snaps compared to 8 given to
Emari Demercado
and Zonovan “Bam” Knight. Suppose Carter could be sold while the iron is hot for a
TreVeyon Henderson
or an
RJ Harvey
. In that case, Carter should be dealt immediately to acquire one of those two players with significantly higher upside that will last longer than the next few weeks.”

Ja’Marr Chase (WR – CIN)
“Last week, I said to buy/hold
Ja’Marr Chase
. I told everybody you have to wait. You have to wait. Chase then proceeds to go for 6-110-2 on 10 targets against the Lions. Mostly coming in the fourth quarter, down 28-3 against a Lions defense depleted of secondary options. This could be Chase’s best game ROS. Take advantage.
Joe Burrow
isn’t coming back anytime soon. And
Jake Browning
‘s on the road versus GB next week. Chase will have productive weeks when he’s playing at home (Weeks 7-9). And the fantasy postseason (Ravens at home/Dolphins) is juicy. But the floor can bottom out with Browning behind the Bengals’ terrible OL. If you can cash out for something really good, I think that’s the move to make. We can always revisit buying Chase closer to the fantasy trade deadline with the postseason closer insight.”
–
Andrew Erickson

FantasyPros

Kyren Williams (RB – LAR)
“Who knew that
Kyren Williams
is a fire dancer? The veteran back has been playing with fire and has managed to avoid any serious burns. The Rams have had a few tough losses this season, but have shown enough to confirm they are Super Bowl contenders. Currently, the RB8 on the season, Williams has been a huge part of their success. However, we have started to see
Blake Corum
be more involved. Last week, Corum benched himself after fumbling, leading to Williams having a season-high 91% snaps. Corum should return to his role immediately and eat into Kyren’s snaps. This week, he faces the Ravens in a great matchup. I expect he’ll string together another great performance, inflating his value and providing the chance to cash out for a top piece returning from injury, such as
CeeDee Lamb
or
George Kittle
.”
– Ellis Johnson (
FantasyPros
)
The
Jaylen Waddle
Debate
Occasionally, our Featured Pros disagree on what to do with one player. In this case, we present both of their arguments and let you decide for yourself which side you’re on.
Buy
“I think
Jaylen Waddle
(WR-MIA) absolutely has the profile of a buy-low candidate right now, especially in the wake of some recent underwhelming production and changing circumstances. Even in a down stretch, Waddle is still seeing targets. He has been involved in the Dolphins’ receiving game despite Miami’s struggles. Waddle has posted 1,000+ yard seasons before, and when the Dolphins’ offense is clicking, he has proven to be a high-level WR2 / target monster. If the offense stabilizes, he has room to rebound. If I were trying to buy Waddle, I would offer a mid-tier WR2 / WR3 + a bench asset. Or a back-end RB2 / flex + a lesser WR. Happy trading!”
–
Jeff Boggis
(
Fantasy Football Empire
)
Sell
“My favorite sell-high candidate is
Jaylen Waddle
. With
Tyreek Hill
injured, many are assuming Waddle will be a target vulture, but that’s not going to happen. His highest reception total in a game so far is six, and he needs touchdowns to even provide WR2 quality weeks. With Waddle likely to see some touchdown regression, I’m looking to trade him for someone like
Chris Olave
, who has a safe floor and plenty of targets each week.”
