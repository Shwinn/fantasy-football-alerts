==================================================

Welcome back, everybody! We’ve got NFL Week 5 officially in the books and a lot to recap from ALL the action! My goal with this weekly piece is to provide you with the most critical KEY ACTION items from every game – waiver wire pickups, trade, add, drop, stash, buy, sell, start, sit, etc. – for your fantasy football team based on what happened the previous week. Let me do the work of scouring through the data and film so you can just follow my lead. As my college marketing professor always said, “Keep it simple, stupid.” The KISS mantra is at its finest.
Obviously, I’ll cite data and what I observed on film from the past weekend’s matchups, highlighting what matters most and what’s potentially just noise. I will make a strong effort to feature players coming off polarizing performances, as they are sure to be the ones fantasy managers have the most question marks about.
Again, the idea behind the Fantasy Forecast (now named BEYOND THE WAIVER WIRE) has always been about identifying which players are running routes, seeing high snap shares, and earning high-value targets, as these tend to be precursors for future fantasy production. And sometimes, they don’t always appear in the normal box score.
So, without further ado…let’s GO beyond the waiver wire for Week 6 to prepare our rosters for future success.
To infinity and beyond (the waiver wire)!
Beyond the Waiver Wire: Fantasy Football Moves to Make
Arizona Cardinals
Add/Sell
Michael Carter
We all wanted to know how the Arizona Cardinals’ backfield would shake out in the wake of
Trey Benson
‘s injury. I wrote
last week
about how heavy I was on the
Michael Carter
side of the backfield over
Emari Demercado
. I was proven correct. In a game where the Cardinals benefitted from mostly positive game script…until things got really off the rails, Carter was the workhorse for Arizona. 18 carries for 51 yards, and five catches for 22 yards on five targets. He led the backfield with a 57% snap rate – playing 20 more snaps (39 vs 19) compared to Demercado. Demercado had one touch in the first half (zero targets).
Does this mean Demercado’s value is nuked? Not entirely. Again, this matchup for Carter was perfect for him to gobble volume. Arizona won’t always be a touchdown-favorite at home. And FWIW, Demercado did rip off a big run for a 72-yard TD call…but it was overturned as a fumble out of the end zone…resulting in a touchback. Woof. At least in the short-term…don’t expect much from Demercado, who might need to change his zip code to Jonathan Gannon’s dog house.
Demercado will have more opportunities in Cardinals’ games with negative game scripts. That being said, Carter is still the Cardinals’ RB to own until Benson returns. Worth mentioning that
Zonovan Knight
also scored a rushing TD (as he also earned two red-zone carries to Carter’s two red-zone carries).
Even though Carter was the lead guy…I do think there is some semblance of this being a committee of sorts, ROS. Gannon was noncommittal about Carter being the starter again in Week 6, even after his blow-up on the sideline due to the Demercado fumble/touchback.
Given the upcoming matchups – Colts, Packers, and a bye week – I think Carter might be a sharp “sell-high” after you added him off waivers this past week. Keep in mind that Carter’s always going to have an expired shelf life with Benson coming back at some point in the second half of the season. Flip him to a desperate manager looking for RB production right now because Carter was very inefficient in his first start against a beatable Titans defense. Just 2.8 yards per carry and a 28% success rate.
According to the
FantasyPros SOS tool
…Arizona’s RB schedule ROS is bottom-8.
Other notes…
Michael Wilson
ran fewer routes than
Zay Jones
.
Trey McBride
has a 32-yard gain removed on an offensive holding call.
TE
Tip Reiman
was carted off the field after sustaining an ankle injury in the third quarter of Sunday’s game against the Titans, Josh Weinfuss of ESPN.com reports.

Atlanta Falcons
Moves to Make: Buy
Drake London
Drake London
did all of his damage in the first half back in Week 4, with 6-95-1 (RZ score) on seven first-half targets. The Falcons’ No. 1 WR finally had the breakout game (38% target share, 40% target rate per route run) that I was hoping for when I was pumping his draft stock all offseason. London remains a buy and target if he can be acquired cheaper coming out of his bye week. I like the schedule coming up after the Falcons’ bye week (
top-6 ROS
). Keep in mind that the Falcons fired their previous WR coach before Week 4, in an effort to get more offensive WR production. So far, so good.
Through four games, London is the WR8 in expected PPG and PFF’s 10th-highest graded WR.
Darnell Mooney
left Week 4 in the third quarter. Limited to just 45% of the snaps. It was noted as a hamstring injury, but he is not expected to miss games with the team coming off the bye week.
Schedule
Week 6: vs. Bills
Week 7: at 49ers
Week 8: vs. Dolphins
Baltimore Ravens
Moves to Make: Buy
Derrick Henry
Baltimore is sooooo banged up.
Can’t really do much with the Ravens but hold their guys. They will likely get destroyed again next week at home versus the Rams if they remain as injured as they currently are. The latest is that
Lamar Jackson
has an “outside shot” of playing in Week 6. Hopefully,
Lamar Jackson
can come healthy out of the Week 7 bye week.
But post-bye week…
It’s a SMASH spot for the Ravens offense – specifically with
Derrick Henry
. Bears/Dolphins. Sharp managers should be looking to buy low on Henry (presuming they have positive records and don’t need the King over the next few games).
Until then, Henry is probably a low-end RB1/high-end RB2 (still scores TDs) while
Zay Flowers
is a WR3. Can’t play anyone else. Flowers is another interesting buy-low with an eye toward the Ravens in the second half of the year. Flowers ranks 6th in PFF grade this season.

Buffalo Bills
Moves to Make: Hold
Keon Coleman
|
Buy
Dalton Kincaid
Dalton Kincaid
continues to deliver strong performances after strong performances. The usage is middling – 54% snap rate in Week 5 – but Kincaid’s hyper-target rate makes him fantasy viable. Being attached to
Josh Allen
also helps.
With the Bills’ rotation of WRs extending to four guys…Kincaid is emerging as the Bills’ pass-catcher to own. Especially given his fantasy TE designation. The Bills TE ranks 7
th
among all TEs in target rate per route run this season (23.5%).
However, I am still holding out some hope for
Keon Coleman
. Was the team’s air yards leader in Week 5 and scored. Even though the sheer target share isn’t bountiful…Coleman has the lead on the high-value targets. However,
Khalil Shakir
did see three red-zone targets versus the Patriots. Shakir also led the team with a 29% target share.
I’d also like to note that Coleman has been in the coach’s doghouse. Didn’t play on the first offensive series. Last year, he was benched for a quarter after being late.

Jalen Coker
Rico Dowdle
rushed for over 200 yards versus the Miami Dolphins. The former Dallas Cowboys RB flashed RB1 potential last season…and it was on full display in Week 5. 67% snap share.
Trevor Etienne
only played 20% of the snaps. He also split route duties with
DeeJay Dallas
.
Chuba Hubbard
is day-to-day, so he may return in Week 6. And although Hubbard would be inserted back as RB1…it’s clear that Dowdle will still have a role.
Tetairoa McMillan
remains a priority buy-low target after seeing a 27% target share in Week 5 (6-73 on eight targets with two more RZ targets). Head and shoulders above every other Panthers WR. Shown an extremely high-floor through 5 games (8-plus targets in each contest). 23% target share and 42% air yards share on the season (10
th
). T-Mac is 8th in expected fantasy points per game as PFF’s 20th-highest graded WR.
Dallas up next. Top-7 schedule ROS for WRs.
Uncle
Rico Dowdle
‘s revenge game next week.
Other notes:
Jalen Coker
‘s 21-day practice window to return has been opened. Stash the talented second-year WR.

Chicago Bears
Moves to Make: Add
Luther Burden
| Sell
D’Andre Swift
| Sell
D.J. Moore
D’Andre Swift
– The Bears’ rushing attack is anemic. I’d anticipate some kind of change to this RB room post-bye week. Swift (66% snap rate in Week 4) is being his uber-inefficient self from last season. Sell before he loses his job outright. Through four games,
D’Andre Swift
has the 10th-worst rushing success rate at 3.3 yards per carry (Bottom-15 PFF rushing grade). A Week 5 bye week has me exploring trade options.
Kyle Monangai
– The rookie played 28% of the snaps in Week 4. Add him if he got dropped during the bye week. I’d like to stay ahead of next report that says, “Bears looking to revamp run game over bye week.” That could mean more of the rookie 7th-rounder. I’m not saying that Monangai is taking over this backfield by any means (because he has also been inefficient). Maybe down the line, but not necessarily in Week 6. I am saying that Swift might be overvalued as a bell cow who has been very inefficient and doesn’t have a lucrative red-zone role. The receiving gives him a nice boost, and that likely won’t change even if he sees a reduced rushing role. Swift has always been a mid-to-low-end fantasy RB2. If you can get more for that…take it.
Rome Odunze
– The second-year breakout is a perfect example of why we chase red-zone usage year over year. Odunze was an end-zone monster in 2024. And in 2025, he has turned those end-zone targets into TDs. Trust the process.
DJ Moore
– Just more low ADOT (4.3) and low-value targets for
DJ Moore
in Week 4, culminating in a 4-38 stat line.
DJ Moore
managers are just keeping their fingers crossed that he gets traded at some point. Because the role Moore has in this 2025 Bears offense is lackluster at best. Moore is the WR48 in expected fantasy PPG this season.
Luther Burden
– I’d also expect Burden to be more involved after the bye week. Keep him stashed. We could very much see the Bears’ offense look different and feature more of Burden and fellow rookie
Colston Loveland
.

Cincinnati Bengals
Moves to Make: Sell
Ja’Marr Chase
Last week, I said to buy/hold
Ja’Marr Chase
. I told everybody you have to wait. You have to wait. Chase then proceeds to go for 6-110-2 on 10 targets against the Lions. Mostly coming in the fourth quarter, down 28-3 against a Lions defense depleted of secondary options. This could be Chase’s best game ROS. Take advantage.
Joe Burrow
isn’t coming back anytime soon. And
Jake Browning
‘s on the road versus GB next week. Chase will have productive weeks when he’s playing at home (Weeks 7-9). And the fantasy postseason (Ravens at home/Dolphins) is juicy. But the floor can bottom out with Browning behind the Bengals’ terrible OL. If you can cash out for something really good, I think that’s the move to make. We can always revisit buying Chase closer to the fantasy trade deadline with the postseason closer insight.
Other notes:
Noah Fant
has a significantly reduced role after missing last week with a concussion.

Quinshon Judkins
There I was…early Sunday morning, moving both Browns TEs down my Week 5 rankings. My rationale? What are the odds that with a rookie QB, either of these guys sniffs the red zone? Woof.
Both
David Njoku
and
Harold Fannin
scored on Sunday with
Dillon Gabriel
making his first start. The Browns’ rookie QB played point guard and thrived getting the ball to his short and intermediate tight end targets.
I really expected the polar opposite impact for Njoku with the QB change. So if you are an Njoku manager, you are ecstatic after he saw a 24% target share in Gabriel’s first start. Also played 96% of the snaps. Njoku is a streaky producer….so this could be the start of something very positive. Ride the wave.
As for investors in
Isaiah Bond
and/or
Jerry Jeudy
. Not so much. Gabriel went 0-for-3 targeting them in the red zone. Njoku and Fannin combined for four red-zone targets (3 for Njoku) and combined for two TDs.
Bond specifically left some meat on the bone with his targets. I think he’s worth the add.
Again, Jeudy is the one who looked most out of place with DG under center. Just three targets despite leading the team in routes run. HC Kevin Stefanski still strongly emphasizes Jeudy is the best WR on the Browns…but that’s not necessarily as bullish as the surface-level comments suggest. This team loves using two TEs, and they just placed their other best WR on IR.

Javonte Williams

Dak Prescott

Jaydon Blue
Dak Prescott
is just on fire. And the fact that he is doing so with so many injuries at WR and across his OL is a testament to the level of quarterback he is playing at. The Cowboys QB tossed four more TDs in Week 5 versus the Jets.
Ryan Flournoy
was the big-time producer…but don’t chase. This was very much personnel and matchup-based. Kavonte Turpin and
CeeDee Lamb
were out.
George Pickens
was getting shadowed by
Sauce Gardner
. I mentioned on the Week 5 rankings show that the middle of the field and/or slot would eat here for Dallas. Hence, 114 yards and nine targets for Flournoy, who operated as the team’s slot receiver in Week 5.
Jake Ferguson
also feasted with 7-49-2 on nine targets.
Miles Sanders
sat out this game, and
Jaydon Blue
was in as the RB2. Just 11 snaps (18%). Juggernaut
Javonte Williams
remains a buy-high. Cowboys HC Brian Schottenheimer recently said that he is indeed the president of the
Javonte Williams
fan club. YLTSI.
The Carolina Panthers are next…

Denver Broncos
Moves to Make: Buy
RJ Harvey

J.K. Dobbins
Pretty typical deployment for the Broncos’ skill players in Week 5 – although
Evan Engram
being more involved was noteworthy. The Broncos put
Lucas Krull
on IR earlier in the week. Engram so a slightly increased role as a result…with 4-33-1 on 6 targets. Still, he only ran a route on 53% of the dropbacks. Also worth noting that
Pat Bryant
ran more routes than
Marvin Mims
, who is incredibly difficult to trust.
J.K. Dobbins
continued to lead the backfield with a 53% snap rate in another very productive outing (led backfield with four red-zone carries). Even so…hold at your own risk. We know the injury track record for Dobbins. But if you are cool just riding it out…be my guest.
RJ Harvey
played fewer snaps than
Tyler Badie
. Gross. This hasn’t been the case since very early in the season. But despite the reduced snaps, Harvey still caught three passes on three targets. Badie was in on the 2-minute drill.

Isaac TeSlaa
If you didn’t sell
David Montgomery
after the Ravens game, now is the time to move him after the Lions played the Bengals. It was a great spot for him (65 rushing yards on 18 carries and one rushing score), and the Lions fed him extra carries because it was a homecoming for the Cincinnati native
Because at this point and the rest of the season, he will be very TD-dependent. And the next two matchups are against tougher run defenses.
Everybody ate versus Cincy….other than
Jameson Williams
. Last week’s buy-low did not pan out. The coaching staff is still very firmly on the side of Jamo…so the time to jump ship is not now. The Bengals are terrible versus the run and against TEs. The matchup didn’t dictate targets for Williams, which, admittedly, have been tougher to come by this season in a crowded Lions offense. Just a 14% target share. But he is the air yards leader (424). He will have week-winning weeks.
Also, the Lions are continuing to pile up defensive back injuries. After losing
D.J. Reed
last week…
Terrion Arnold
also got banged up and left the game versus the Bengals.
Brian Branch
and
Rock Ya-Sin
also got banged up in the game. WR
Kalif Raymond
also got hurt in this game.
That could lead to more opportunities for Williams. And it would also increase playing time for rookie
Isaac TeSlaa
…who just makes highlight reel plays every time he sets foot on the football field.

Houston Texans
Moves to Make: Hold
The
Woody Marks
breakout did not continue into Week 5…
Even though the rookie out-snapped
Nick Chubb
(39% versus 34%), the veteran RB out-carried Marks (11 vs 7) and was more efficient. Mr. 5-yards-per-carry is back (well, at least he was vs the Ravens).
Each RB saw one target apiece. I think this game is just a reminder that Chubb isn’t going away completely. Even when it looked like Marks was taking over the last few weeks, Chubb was still involved. And I think he’s been running fine despite the circumstances (Texans OL). Chubb owns a higher YPC and success rate than Marks this season. Marks has the second-worst rushing success rate (25%) this season.
But keep in mind that overall snap counts are a bit skewed, given
Dameon Pierce
got some run at the end of the game. And Marks still has had a role in the red zone…with two more red-zone carries versus the Ravens (including at the 4-yard line). Chubb scored on a 27-yard run.
C.J. Stroud
won’t toss 4 TDs every week.
With Houston on bye in Week 6, it’s a reminder to buy into rookies seeing larger roles. Marks might be a nice buy-low after he failed to live up to the hype in a juicy matchup. That being said, Houston has a brutal schedule after the bye week…Seahawks, 49ers, Broncos, before things get lighter. The QB schedule is tied with the Raiders for the toughest ROS.
Best to leave the Texans’ offense on other teams for now. But for those who have Texans hold them and hope that they can build off this performance versus the Ravens.

Indianapolis Colts
Moves to Make: Buy
Michael Pittman Jr.
Michael Pittman Jr.
is really showing that last year was a fluke with his targets because of his back injury. He’s emerging as the alpha in the Colts’ passing game with
Daniel Jones
under center.
23% target share this season for the Colts. He’s been running hot with TDs…but I don’t think that’s super abnormal. Pittman’s been overdue for TD regression throughout his entire NFL career. 2025 might just be his year when he hits double-digit scores.
Adonai Mitchell
had a reduced role (just six snaps) after his epic blunders last week.
Ashton Dulin
took over his snaps/routes with
Alec Pierce
missing another week due to his concussion.
Josh Downs
also benefited from the loss of other Colts WRs. Lead the team in targets (6-54). Seven of his eight targets came in the first half. Downs is PFF’s 10th-highest graded WR this season.
Other notes:
Coach Shane Steichen confirmed Monday that their kicker will miss the remainder of the season after suffering a torn ACL and MCL in his right knee in Sunday’s win over the Raiders, Stephen Holder of ESPN.com reports.
The Colts also lost DT
Grover Stewart
and another CB,
Mike Hilton
, to injuries.

Bhayshul Tuten

LeQuint Allen

Brian Thomas Jr.
was the big-play guy…going 4-80 on six targets.
Tight end
Brenton Strange
was ruled out from returning to Monday’s game against the Chiefs, John Oehser of the Jaguars’ official site reports.
Hunter Long
would start in his place – and he has a good matchup in Week 6 vs Seattle (third-most fantasy points allowed to TEs this season).
Starting offensive lineman/center,
Robert Hainsey

Rice will return to the Chiefs after Week 6. He was a fantasy WR1 last season before his injury. Obviously, the WR room is different from last season with
Xavier Worthy
,
Marquise Brown
, and
Tyquan Thornton
healthy and more involved. That being said, Rice still has the chance to be a force down the stretch for KC….and he is worth kicking the tires on – especially if the Rice manager in your league has a losing record.
Rice’s impending return is also your last chance to trade away
Travis Kelce
. He went 7-61-1 on Monday Night Football. Sell high.
So much for the expanded
Brashard Smith
role, the Chiefs’ rookie RB touched the ball four times (3 receptions and one carry from the Jags’ 6-yard line) – half of what we saw last week. He only played six offensive snaps (9%). With
Isiah Pacheco
(62%) and
Kareem Hunt
(33%) still heavily involved…Smith is a hold in only extremely deep formats. Needs at least one injury before we can have any confidence with him for fantasy purposes.
Pacheco had a few explosive runs…while playing a season-high snap share. However, these are low-calorie touches…given that Hunt continues to rear his ugly head both in the red zone (2 rushing TDs) and on passing downs.

in PPG. He continues to get it done in this offense regardless of the QB. I think this kind of makes him a sneaky buy-low candidate with concerns about how his production will be when
J.J. McCarthy
returns. It’s certainly possible that it gets worse with the young QB back. However, there’s still a real upside case with JJ. Jefferson’s floor is so high that I think it might be worth the risk to see what his asking price is in your league.
The Browns were a tough matchup for
Jordan Mason
. Luckily, he scored and only fumbled once. Even so…Minnesota is on a bye this week. Then it’s the Eagles/Chargers/Lions. By the time the schedule eases up and the offensive line gets healthy,
Aaron Jones
might also return. Put him on the block and see if you can get any decent returns.

Ashton Jeanty
Ashton Jeanty
‘s receiving usage ( 5 catches and 7 targets) shouldn’t go unnoticed. Without
Brock Bowers
or
Michael Mayer
….the short areas of the field are looking for targets. Hence, Jeanty’s target boost.
Also, do not be swayed by the carries/snaps for Jeanty.
Raheem Mostert
had 6 of his seven touches to close out the loss in the fourth quarter.
The rookie is overcoming OL issues. And I think they continue to lean heavily on him. The Raiders – per the SOS tool – have a top-3 ROS schedule for fantasy RBs.
Just a terrible game for
Jakobi Meyers
. Not involved whatsoever. Given how involved he usually is (high-floor player), this stands out like a sore thumb.
Other notes:
Coach Pete Carroll said Monday that Bowers (knee) is considered week-to-week, Paul H. Gutierrez of the Raiders’ official site reports.
Your job. No, your mission. Make a trade with the
Brock Bowers
manager.

Moves to Make: Sell
Keenan Allen
| Hold
Ladd McConkey
| Add
Hassan Haskins
and
Kimani Vidal
This was supposed to be
Ladd McConkey
week. The matchup was divine. But
Keenan Allen
ends up leading the team in targets (9) and yards (58) to go with two more red-zone targets.
Quentin Johnston
comes back to Earth (4-40) but is still involved. McConkey catches just five balls for 39 yards. He scores! And he had a punt return TD (called back on a penalty). Even so, you are happy you played him. But I think now, he’s more of a fantasy WR3. The second-year WR is matchup dependent, and probably needs at least one injury to either Allen/QJ to produce anything like his rookie numbers. The upside case still exists – Allen is 33 years old and hasn’t played a full season over the last few years – so I like holding him. If anything, I’d want to make sure I can pair Allen/McConkey on a roster.
It’s also possible that with
Omarion Hampton
gone, the offense goes back to ignoring RBs in the passing game (status quo in Greg Roman’s offense). The boosted RB targets may also be more related to the OL injuries. Either way…Ladd’s highest target game came in Week 1…when Hampton saw just two targets.
Coach Jim Harbaugh said Monday that
Omarion Hampton
(ankle) will be placed on injured reserve in the coming days, Daniel Popper of The Athletic reports.
Massive blow for the Chargers, who are down so many starters across their offensive line as well as running back.
Hassan Haskins
and
Kimani Vidal
are expected to pick up the slack…but I’m not optimistic about either behind this offensive line. Haskins had a 0% rushing success rate in Week 5 (5 carries for 13 yards).
The duo split carries in Week 5 (21% snaps each). Haskins has been on the active roster, whereas Vidal has been on the practice squad. I think I slightly lean Haskins over Vidal off waivers…but both should be added to see how things shake out. However, I wouldn’t be overly bullish on either guy. There’s a reason why the Bolts went out his offseason and acquired both
Najee Harris
and
Omarion Hampton
. Haskins has ties to Jim Harbaugh back to Michigan. But the most likely scenario is a split backfield. It’s what Greg Roman prefers…and when you have a backfield of JAGs. You probably don’t want to commit to one RB. Haskins and Vidal are different types of RBs anyway, so they are better deployed in tandem. Vidal did see the most red-zone touches (3) in Week 5.
Also, given the injury to Hampton. Don’t be surprised if the Chargers sign a street free agent like
Gus Edwards
.

Moves to Make: Add
Blake Corum
Kyren Williams
and
Blake Corum
both lost fumbles on Thursday Night. Williams was particularly bad, given that it may have cost the Rams a victory. Even so, Williams has looked good, and his explosion in the passing game will be something to monitor moving forward. Still, the fumbles are piling up. I wouldn’t anticipate Williams seeing another 91% snap share in Week 6. Still, he’s the RB1 for this team even if his snaps reduce back to the 65-75% range. Also, the Ravens are a smash spot for Williams and the Rams’ run game.
Corum is still a high-end handcuff with tremendous upside.
Davis Allen
played the majority of TE snaps with
Tyler Higbee
out.

Jaylen Waddle

Darren Waller
Darren Waller
was heavily involved from the jump, seeing all of his receiving usage in the first half. Keep using him. I think he will be a serviceable fantasy TE until he gets hurt. And for those that streamed Waller (
Tucker Kraft
bye-week replacement), sell high to the
Brock Bowers
manager.
Jaylen Waddle
WR1 szn. 6-110-1 on ten targets (25% target share and two RZ targets).
Jaylen Waddle
is 8th in PFF grade this season.
Malik Washington
did not see the spike in usage many had hoped. He played fewer snaps than
Nick Westbrook-Ikhine
. However, he did run more routes and saw more targets. Hold if you picked him up for one more week. Washington caught a lot of passes behind the LOS but couldn’t generate much YAC. Also caught both of his targets in the red zone…but that resulted in -6 yards.

New England Patriots
Moves to Make: Buy/Hold
TreVeyon Henderson
| Buy
Stefon Diggs
The universe is doing everything in its power to get TreyVeon Henderson more involved.
Rhamondre Stevenson
fumbled again.
Antonio Gibson
is going to miss the rest of the season with a torn ACL. Henderson continues to be a buy – even if the statistics say otherwise. With the backfield down to just 2 RBs…(with one having a serious fumbling problem), it’s not hard to see how this works out for the rookie RB. Buy.
In Week 5, Henderson played 50% of the snaps to Stevenson’s 52% snap share. Stevenson got the red-zone touches, but we know his role is on extremely thin ice.
Stefon Diggs
continues to dominate in the Pats offense…after he broke out in Week 4. 10-146 on 12 targets (40% target share). He’s back to pre-injury form and is the WR1 for the rest of the season for New England. And he is so overdue for a TD score. He seemed to fall just short of the end zone on multiple occasions versus Buffalo despite looks near the end zone. Diggs is PFF’s 5th-highest graded WR this season.
Patriots are BUYs because their schedule is so easy for the rest of the season. If you could buy-low on
Drake Maye
…after a zero TD game…DO IT.

Moves to Make: Add
Kendre Miller

Alvin Kamara
| Add
Taysom Hill
Alvin Kamara
is still seeing red-zone touches and targets, so he still holds value. But you’d be lying as Kamara manager if you weren’t just a bit concerned about
Kendre Miller
‘s increased involvement.
Miller led the Saints in carries in Week 5, playing 39% of the snaps to Kamara’s 56% snap rate. Miller was also more efficient, carrying the ball 10 times for 41 yards.
This season, Kamara is PFF’s 14
th
-lowest graded RB. Miller is PFF’s 4
th
-highest graded RB.
But what was even more concerning was
Taysom Hill
stepping back into a role with six carries of his own on just nine snaps played (14%). He touched the ball on 7 of his nine offensive snaps (including a rush at the Giants’ 12-yard line).
Kamara’s targets were present here in Week 5 (6), but this number has fluctuated weekly. The Patriots’ defense has also been tough on RBs. And frankly, the Saints offense just isn’t good enough to support two fantasy RBs, let alone three different players seeing carries. Put Kamara on the trade block.
It’s October, so naturally, another fantasy football tight end had to transform back into a pumpkin. Juwan Johson – despite an 85% snap share and 81% route participation – caught just two passes for 17 yards.
So, although the narrative that his role would get nuked with
Foster Moreau
and Hill back…it only decreased slightly. That being said…those guys probably will combine for more than six routes moving forward. If you’ve been riding with Johnson…might be wise to explore other TE options.
Other notes:
Saints lost safety
Justin Reid
with a concussion.

Cam Skattebo
We love
Cam Skattebo
. He’s a fun player to cheer for. But the upcoming schedule is brutal. Eagles twice and a road game at the Broncos, wedged in between. With
Tyrone Tracy
also making his way back to the starting lineup (limited on Monday’s injury report), we could see Skattebo’s role and production dip in the upcoming weeks. He is the darling of every football fan’s eye right now, but he still plays for the New York Giants. He also lost a fumble in Week 5 that was returned for a TD. Brian Daboll isn’t always kind to RBs that put the ball on the ground. And the way that he just invites contact…well, I’m not exactly confident that will necessarily last over an entire NFL season.
Theo Johnson
has been a huge winner since
Jaxson Dart
took over at QB. Tied for the team lead in targets (8) with two more TD receptions (four red-zone targets). The second-year TE played 82% of the snaps as a near every-down player. If you are hurting at tight end, you could do much worse than the Giants’ TE1.
Darius Slayton
hurt his hamstring versus the Saints, so I’d expect
Wan’Dale Robinson
to be the de facto WR1 for Week 6. Robinson failed to catch a red-zone target last week.

played 62% of the snaps with

out.
Isaiah Davis
played 40% of the snaps. Hall did get “injured” after he fumbled toward the end of the first half, but he returned to start the second half. Touches were still very much in favor of Hall over Davis (18-4). Hall also saw a goal-line carry from the 3-yard line in pursuit of his first TD score this season. Alas, stuffed for a 4-yard loss.
Even so, the bell cow usage and 100-plus yards from scrimmage for Hall make him a buy with Allen on IR (out for 8-12 weeks). After the Broncos…Hall will face the Panthers and Bengals before the bye week.
Mason Taylor
saw two red-zone targets but didn’t score. That was to go along with the rest of his strong production – 9-67 on team-high 12 targets.

| Add
Will Shipley
A.J. Brown
did his best against
Patrick Surtain
(5-43 on eight targets)…but we knew the matchup would favor
DeVonta Smith
‘s box score. The Slim Reaper went OFF, and had more production left on the cutting room floor (30-yard gain wiped away on a flag).
Unfortunately, the Eagles’ throwing 38 times per game isn’t the way they want to play.
Sell high on Smith with an inevitable heavy ground attack on deck for Thursday Night versus the Giants.
Saquon Barkley
had six carries in Week 5. That’s not repeating in Week 6.
Also, it’s worth noting that Barkley was listed on the Week 6 injury report with a knee injury. Make sure
Will Shipley
isn’t available on waivers. And put Barkley on the trade block. He hasn’t been the same guy as last season. Eagles OL has regressed. Barkley is PFF’s 5th-lowest graded RB. The schedule has been tough, so things should be better the next few weeks in some plus spots versus the Giants. Would entertain selling HIGH if he pops off versus the Giants for a 100-yard/multi-TD game.
Other notes:
Eagles’ offensive line isn’t playing at the same level that they have in years past.
Landon Dickerson
is hurt again.

Pittsburgh Steelers
Moves to Make: Add
Kenneth Gainwell
| Sell
DK Metcalf
Kenneth Gainwell
– Full-blown bell cow back in Week 4. We got news early Sunday morning that
Jaylen Warren
was out. The Steelers turned to Gainwell, who played 77% of the snaps and was close to scoring 3 TDs (27% target share).
Kaleb Johnson
– Johnson was active in Week 4 and saw his highest involvement as a rookie. 21% of the snaps (11) with 6 carries for 22 yards. With Gainwell stealing the show, the 2025 optimistic outlook for Johnson now comes with leapfrogging both Warren/Gainwell on the depth chart. No need to hold him through the bye week. Not worth adding until we see something else.
Jaylen Warren
– I viewed Warren as a winner post Week 3 after a strong outing versus the Patriots. But with a bye week coming up and Gainwell’s massive performance, I think this Steelers backfield could morph into more of a committee. And that’s not even factoring in Johnson, who – like a lot of rookies – could see an expanded role post bye week.
DK Metcalf
buried me as a fade in Week 4 – ripping off a HUGE 80-yard catch-and-run to the house. But the facts are the facts. Through four games, Metcalf is outside the top-50 in expected fantasy points per game. 3rd-most points scored ABOVE expectation. And that’s because he owns a super low Adot (5.9) and a 20% target share (5.5 targets per game). He has scored in three straight games. Metcalf’s current usage (low-aDOT, low volume) suggests that his production will tail off dramatically. Sell high.

San Francisco 49ers
Moves to Make: Add
Kendrick Bourne
| Sell
Christian McCaffrey
| Buy
Ricky Pearsall
CMC is on pace for 442 touches through 5 weeks. What could go wrong? McCaffery’s receiving usage has been off the charts…but eventually the 49ers will get most of their starting WRs and TEs back. Consider that CMC has been bad as a rusher…right now is the time to flip him for MAX ROI. He is PFF’s 12th-lowest graded RB this season, averaging 3.1 yards per carry with the NFL’s 9th-lowest success rate.
Assuming that
Ricky Pearsall
‘s health is in check…I want to buy low on him. However, he was not at the 49ers’ early week Monday practice (
Jauan Jennings
was there,
Brock Purdy
was not).
Before making a deal for Pearsall…let’s get him back to practice first. Not following for another
Trey Benson
fiasco. But if he’s healthy. Smash buy. Top-15 in yards this year despite battling injuries. And he is PFF’s 13th-highest graded WR.
With
George Kittle
a long shot to play in Week 6…
Jake Tonges
will get the starting nod again at tight end.
Kendrick Bourne
is also worth the add coming off a breakout game. He has a real connection with
Mac Jones
, but expect Jennings to return to the 49ers starting lineup as soon as Week 6.

Week 6: at Buccaneers
Seattle Seahawks
Moves to Make: None
Another week of Seattle Seahawks backfield watch. And another week, it’s a split backfield.
Kenneth Walker
plays 44% of the snaps to
Zach Charbonnet
‘s 56%. But like always, Walker is more efficient rushing (10 for 86) while Charbonnet chugs along (9 for 36) but scores the red-zone TD. Who’s tilting? At least Walker managers occasionally see him also see red-zone carries, as it’s not every single time they take him out to put in Charbonnet when they approach the goal line.
Tight end
AJ Barner
caught 2 TDs on three red-zone targets while playing 80% of the snaps. Still, I think his boom was more matchup-based than predictive.
Seattle won’t have LB
Derick Hall
versus the Jaguars in Week 6.

Rachaad White

Bucky Irving
sidelined.
Sean Tucker
played just 13 snaps (21%). White scored 2 rushing TDs and caught four passes for 30 yards. White out-touched Tucker 3-1 in the red zone.
Chris Godwin
…saw a red-zone target but was otherwise not heavily involved. Stark contrast from last week’s 10 targets. Still, let
Stefon Diggs
‘ slow start be a reminder that Godwin is still knocking off the rust after his injury last season.
Other notes:
The Buccaneers’ secondary is still very hurt.

Tennessee Titans
Moves to Make:

Tony Pollard
| Add
Calvin Ridley
Tyjae Spears
made his return to the lineup in Week 5, but
Tony Pollard
remained the bell cow. 73% snap share to Spears’ 25% snap share. However, given this was Spears’ first game back, it’s not surprising that he was eased back in. He got his touch in the middle of the first quarter.
Cam Ward
also said (according to the game broadcast team) that “Superman’s back” when referencing the return of Spears to the lineup.
With another touch running matchup – the Raiders – on deck for the Titans, I’d STILL be trying to get out of the Pollard business. After LV, it’s Patriots, Colts, and Chargers before a Week 10 bye week.
Calvin Ridley
finally had a good game after many (like me) had given up hope. 42% air yards share (152 air yards) with a 23% target share. We saw last year that veterans like
Terry McLaurin
and
Courtland Sutton
start slow with rookie 1
st
-round QBs. Positive development for Ridley. If he were dropped, I’d scoop him back up.
Other notes:
The Titans’ TE room became a committee. There were reports/rumblings last week that we could see more of rookie
Gunnar Helm
. That was correct as he split routes with
Chig Okonkwo
50/50. Helm actually played more snaps as well and earned the lone Titans’ red-zone target.

Deebo Samuel
Trust the process. In Bill we trust! As bad as my
Trey Benson
“buy” call aged (like spoiled milk), buying Croskey-Merritt aged like fine wine. Full takeover in Week 5. 47% snap share and drew the start. Nearly a flawless day for the super explosive rookie RB (aside from a lost fumble) as he averaged 7.9 yards per carry and 19.5 yards per reception. Totaled 111 rushing yards and scored two TDs.
Buy
good
RBs. Bears/Cowboys up next. Saddle up, Bill. No.1 schedule rest of season for RBs? The Washington Commanders.
Chris Rodriguez
played 25% of the snaps, and so did
Jeremy McNichols
. C-Rob might be annoying in red-zone situations (out-carried JCM 4-2 in the red zone). 80% of his carries came inside the 14-yard line (at the end of the game). But JCM did at least score from the 5-yard line.
Other notes:
Coach Dan Quinn said Monday the Commanders are optimistic about McLaurin (quadriceps) having a chance to play in next Monday night’s game against the Bears, Tashan Reed of The Washington Post reports.
Terry McLaurin
‘s season just seems destined to fail after he held out all of training camp. But his return figures to put a damper on
Deebo Samuel
, WR1 szn. Make trades accordingly.
