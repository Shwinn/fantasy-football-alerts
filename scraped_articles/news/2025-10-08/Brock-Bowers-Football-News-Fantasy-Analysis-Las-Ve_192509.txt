Brock Bowers (knee) not practicing Wednesday
Brock Bowers (knee) is not participating in Las Vegas' practice on Wednesday.
Fantasy Impact
The star tight end is not taking part in Wednesday's practice. He is trying to recover from a knee injury that has been nagging him ever since the season opener. It looks like he may be sidelined in Week 6 because of it, and if that's the case, fantasy managers should expect Michael Mayer to see more work as a result.

Brock Bowers (knee) considered week-to-week
Las Vegas Raiders head coach Pete Carroll called tight end Brock Bowers "week-to-week" with a knee injury that sidelined him in Week 5.
Fantasy Impact
Carroll has become notorious for being unreliable when it comes to injury information, so it was no surprise when Bowers, who seemed to be trending down, was inactive despite Carroll asserting his expectation for him to play. Bowers admitted that he was unable to move to the level he expected, and so it makes sense that he may sit out for a bit to recover. Las Vegas plays Tennessee and Kansas City before getting a bye week, and so it could be possible that Bowers is out until then. Michael Mayer should be the team's top tight end option, but Ian Thomas led the team in snaps in Week 5 with Bowers and Mayer out.
