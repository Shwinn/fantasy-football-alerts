Ted Chmyz
Correspondent
@tchmyz
Bio
While he is an experienced writer and editor, Ted Chmyz is first and foremost a fantasy football addict and fantasy football analyst. His love for fantasy football was first sparked at 14 years old when he drafted Josh Gordon in THAT 2013 season en route to his first of many fantasy football championships. Since then, he has not been able to get enough of the world’s best game. Ted will take any chance to play or write about every format of fantasy football, from Redraft to Dynasty to Best Ball, and everything in between. While he’s certainly more of a stats nerd than a film bro, Ted leaves no stone unturned when looking for an edge — he watches every single game, every Sunday, all at once.  
Since making his fantasy-writing debut for PlayerProfiler in 2021 as a fantasy football analyst, Ted has written hundreds of fantasy football articles for FantasyPros, PlayerProfiler, FantasySP, and DrRoto.com. He has also spent countless hours using a combination of Google Sheets and some truly horrific self-taught R skills to calculate new stats using publicly available data. He is always willing to answer a question, talk trades, or debate the right draft pick at a certain position, so feel free to hit him up @tchmyz on Twitter or Bluesky.
