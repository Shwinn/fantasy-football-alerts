Fantasy Impact:
The star tight end is not taking part in Wednesday's practice. He is trying to recover from a knee injury that has been nagging him ever since the season opener. It looks like he may be sidelined in Week 6 because of it, and if that's the case, fantasy managers should expect Michael Mayer to see more work as a result.
