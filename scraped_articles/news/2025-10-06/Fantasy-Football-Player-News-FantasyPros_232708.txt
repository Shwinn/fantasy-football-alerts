Xavier Worthy (shoulder/ankle) officially active for Week 5
Mon, Oct 6th 6:51pm EDT
By
Jesse Garcia
Chiefs WR Xavier Worthy (shoulder/ankle) is officially active for Week 5.
Fantasy Impact:
Worthy was added to the injury report with a questionable tag late Sunday, but the move was more of a precaution. The Chiefs will have Worthy on the field against the Jaguars, giving Patrick Mahomes his best threat at wide receiver.
