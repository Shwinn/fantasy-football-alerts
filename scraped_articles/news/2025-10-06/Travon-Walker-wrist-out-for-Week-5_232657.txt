Jaguars EDGE Travon Walker is out tonight, per source.
Incredibly tough player to try to come back in 1 week from wrist surgery but needs more time.

Fantasy Impact:
Walker just underwent wrist surgery and will need more time to recover. Considering he was only considered day-to-day, Walker likely has a chance to return in Week 6 against Seattle.
