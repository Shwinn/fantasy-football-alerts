Bio
I currently live in my happy place, as in 45 minutes from Capital One arena in Washington D.C. There is nothing better then getting to chat about sports, and I’m excited to be a part of the team that provides updates on the top players in the NHL. It has always been a dream of mine to work in the sports industry.
