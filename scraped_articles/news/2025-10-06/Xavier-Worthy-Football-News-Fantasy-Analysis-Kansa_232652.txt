Availability
Xavier Worthy (shoulder/ankle) officially active for Week 5
Chiefs WR Xavier Worthy (shoulder/ankle) is officially active for Week 5.
Fantasy Impact
Worthy was added to the injury report with a questionable tag late Sunday, but the move was more of a precaution. The Chiefs will have Worthy on the field against the Jaguars, giving Patrick Mahomes his best threat at wide receiver.

Xavier Worthy (shoulder/ankle) now questionable for MNF
The Chiefs have announced that WR Xavier Worthy (shoulder/ankle) is questionable for Monday’s game.
Fantasy Impact
Worthy was able to practice in full during the first two sessions of the week, but apparently aggravated his ankle or shoulder enough to put his status Monday in question. Fantasy managers will want to monitor the Chiefs’ inactives ahead of Monday Night Football.

Xavier Worthy totals 83 yards in return from injury
Xavier Worthy caught five of eight targets for 83 yards in his first game back as the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Baltimore Ravens 37-20.
Fantasy Impact
Xavier Worthy made his return from a shoulder injury and immediately reminded fantasy managers of his upside, catching five passes for 83 yards. He led the Kansas City Chiefs in receiving yards and gave Patrick Mahomes the vertical threat this offense has been missing. Worthy’s 37-yard reception was a key play that helped Kansas City keep momentum. With Rashee Rice still suspended and Hollywood Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster playing complementary roles, Worthy should continue to see valuable opportunities. If he can stay healthy, he should be an every week starter.

Xavier Worthy (shoulder) not expected to be limited Sunday
The Chiefs say Xavier Worthy "will not be limited in any fashion” on Sunday against the Ravens.
Fantasy Impact
Clay did add they had some concern about potential reinjury. Worthy should be viewed as an upside WR2 for fantasy managers in his return from injury.

Xavier Worthy (shoulder) expected to play Sunday
Xavier Worthy (shoulder) is expected to be available to play in Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens.
Fantasy Impact
The young wideout has missed a couple of games thanks to a shoulder injury that he suffered in the season opener, but HC Andy Reid told reporters that he expects him to play in Week 4. We will get an official injury designation for him sometime after practice on Friday, but fantasy managers should be gearing up for him to play and see a full workload against the Ravens.
