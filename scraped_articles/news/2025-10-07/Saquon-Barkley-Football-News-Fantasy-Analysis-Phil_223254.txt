Saquon Barkley (knee) estimated as limited Tuesday
Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley was listed as a limited participant in the team's estimated practice report on Tuesday, Oct. 7.
Fantasy Impact
Barkley was listed as an estimated DNP on Monday, and NFL Network's Ian Rapoport said it was because he left Week 5's contest with soreness. However, it was not expected to impact his status ahead of Thursday Night Football in Week 6. Getting upgraded to limited, even in an estimated report, is a positive sign, and on a short week, Barkley could likely be limited again on Wednesday.

Saquon Barkley (knee) estimated as DNP Monday
Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley was listed as a non-participant in the team’s estimated practice report on Monday, Oct. 6, ahead of Thursday Night Football in Week 6.
Fantasy Impact
Given that this was an estimated practice report one day after a down-to-the-wire loss, this should be taken with a grain of salt. However, Barkley did only receive six carries and played a season-low 72% of the snaps. According to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, Barkley had “general soreness coming out of the game and fully expects to play,” but this should be monitored heading into TNF.

Saquon Barkley reaches end zone in Week 5 loss
Saquon Barkley carried the ball six times for 30 yards while also hauling in all three of his targets for 58 yards and one touchdown in the Eagles' 21-17 Week 5 loss to the Broncos.
Fantasy Impact
Barkley has made the most of an otherwise modest start to the season out of the Philadelphia backfield, reaching the end zone in four of five games for the Eagles. The running back will look wreak havoc on his former team in a Week 6 matchup against the New York Giants.

Saquon Barkley reaches end zone in Week 4 win
Saquon Barkley carried the ball 19 times for 43 yards and one touchdown while also hauling in all four of his targets for 31 yards in the Eagles’ 31-25 Week 4 win over the Buccaneers.
Fantasy Impact
Barkley has made the most of an otherwise underwhelming start to the season, finding the end zone in three of the first four games despite finishing with less than 60 rushing yards in three of those contests. The running back will look to find success on the ground against the Denver Broncos in Week 5.

Saquon Barkley quiet in Week 3 win
Saquon Barkley carried the ball 18 times for 46 yards in the Eagles’ 33-26 Week 3 win over the Rams.
Fantasy Impact
Barkley was unable to find much running room against a stout Los Angeles defensive front, finishing with less than 60 rushing yards for the first time this season. The running back remains an RB1 option in all formats and will look to get back on track against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 4.
