The Chargers are signing Nyheim Hines to the practice squad after working him out today, per source.
He was with the Chargers during training camp. With the position thin, Hines has a chance to play this week

Fantasy Impact:
With rookie running back Omarion Hampton (ankle) placed on injured reserve and Najee Harris (Achilles) out for the year, the Chargers need depth. Hassan Haskins is expected to lead the way, but Miller-Hines and Kimani Vidal could mix in off the practice squad in a pass-heavy offense.
