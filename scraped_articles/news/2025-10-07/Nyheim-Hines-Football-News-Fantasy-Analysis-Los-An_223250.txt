Nyheim Hines signs with Chargers' practice squad
The Los Angeles Chargers are signing running back Nyheim Miller-Hines to their practice squad.
Fantasy Impact
With rookie running back Omarion Hampton (ankle) placed on injured reserve and Najee Harris (Achilles) out for the year, the Chargers need depth. Hassan Haskins is expected to lead the way, but Miller-Hines and Kimani Vidal could mix in off the practice squad in a pass-heavy offense.

Nyheim Miller-Hines cut by Chargers
Nyheim Miller-Hines has been cut by the Los Angeles Chargers.
Fantasy Impact
To no surprise, Miller-Hines has been cut before the start of the regular season for the Chargers. He was always a long shot to make the roster, but the fact that he didn't make the team paired with Najee Harris starting on the active roster suggests that the latter may be ready to play sooner rather than later for the team.
