Fantasy Impact:
Barkley was listed as an estimated DNP on Monday, and NFL Network's Ian Rapoport said it was because he left Week 5's contest with soreness. However, it was not expected to impact his status ahead of Thursday Night Football in Week 6. Getting upgraded to limited, even in an estimated report, is a positive sign, and on a short week, Barkley could likely be limited again on Wednesday.
